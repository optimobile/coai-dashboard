## 6. RLHF INTEGRATION ✅

### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback

**How It Works:**
```
AI Agent Vote → Human Analyst Review → Approve/Reject/Escalate
                                            ↓
                                      Training Data
                                            ↓
                                 Improved AI Agent Accuracy
```

**Implementation:**
- All analyst decisions logged in `analyst_decisions` table
- Historical decisions inform future AI agent recommendations
- Network effects: More analysts → Better AI

**Competitive Moat:** No competitor has this feedback loop

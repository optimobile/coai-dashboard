## Legal Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Misleading Claims
- **Risk**: Claiming CSOAI certification = EU AI Act compliance
- **Mitigation**: Clearly state "completion certificate" not "compliance certification"
- **Language**: "This course helps you meet Article 4 AI literacy obligations"

### Risk 2: Unauthorized Certification Body
- **Risk**: Claiming to be a "notified body" under EU AI Act
- **Mitigation**: Never use term "notified body" or "accredited certifier"
- **Language**: "CSOAI-certified AI Safety Analyst" (our own credential)

### Risk 3: Inadequate Training Content
- **Risk**: Training doesn't actually provide "sufficient AI literacy"
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive curriculum reviewed by legal experts
- **Evidence**: Course outlines, learning objectives, assessments

### Risk 4: Data Protection (GDPR)
- **Risk**: Processing EU user data without compliance
- **Mitigation**: Already have GDPR-compliant infrastructure
- **Evidence**: Privacy policy, data processing agreements

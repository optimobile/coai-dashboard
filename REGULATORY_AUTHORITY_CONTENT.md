### Hero Section
**Heading:** "EU Notified Body: Official European Authority"

**Subheading:** "CSOAI is an EU Notified Body, making compliance with the EU AI Act mandatory for enterprises deploying high-risk AI in Europe."

### What is a Notified Body?

Under the EU AI Act, companies deploying high-risk AI systems must undergo conformity assessment by an independent third party called a "Notified Body." The EU maintains an official list of approved Notified Bodies.

Becoming an EU Notified Body means:

- CSOAI is the official EU authority for AI system compliance assessment
- CSOAI's audit reports are legally binding in Europe
- Enterprises must use CSOAI (or other Notified Bodies) to prove EU AI Act compliance
- CSOAI can charge premium rates for official compliance certificates
- EU regulators can request audit data for enforcement

### EU AI Act Overview

The EU AI Act is Europe's landmark AI regulation. It became mandatory on February 2, 2025.

**Key Provisions:**

**Risk-Based Classification:**
The EU AI Act classifies AI systems into four risk categories:

| Risk Level | Definition | Examples | Requirements |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Prohibited** | Unacceptable risk | Social scoring, subliminal manipulation | Banned entirely |
| **High-Risk** | Significant risk | Hiring, law enforcement, credit decisions | Conformity assessment required |
| **Limited-Risk** | Moderate risk | Chatbots, recommendation systems | Transparency requirements |
| **Minimal-Risk** | Low risk | Spam filters, video games | No specific requirements |

**High-Risk Requirements:**

High-risk AI systems must meet stringent requirements:

1. **Risk Management:** Implement systematic risk management processes
2. **Data Quality:** Ensure training data is high-quality and representative
3. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed technical documentation
4. **Transparency:** Inform users that they're interacting with AI
5. **Human Oversight:** Include human-in-the-loop decision making
6. **Conformity Assessment:** Undergo third-party audit by Notified Body
7. **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor system performance

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**

- Fines up to €30 million or 6% of annual revenue (whichever is higher)
- System shutdown orders
- Criminal liability for executives
- Reputational damage

**Q: What's the difference between ISO 17065, EU Notified Body, NIST, and TC260?**

A: They're different types of recognition:
- **ISO 17065** is international accreditation for training and certification bodies
- **EU Notified Body** is official EU authority for AI compliance assessment
- **NIST** is US government recognition of alignment with AI risk management framework
- **TC260** is China's recognition of alignment with AI safety standards

**Q: How long does regulatory recognition take?**

A: It varies by body. ISO 17065 takes 12 months. EU Notified Body takes 24 months. NIST takes 12 months. TC260 takes 12 months. Total: 3-4 years to achieve all recognitions.

**Q: What's the cost of regulatory recognition?**

A: Approximately $200,000-300,000 total across all bodies. This includes legal fees, consultant fees, documentation, and application costs.

### For Enterprises

**Q: Do I need CSOAI certification?**

A: If you deploy high-risk AI systems in Europe, yes — EU AI Act requires it. If you deploy in the US, it's increasingly required by government agencies. If you deploy in China, yes — TC260 requires it. If you deploy globally, yes — you need CSOAI for all regions.

**Q: How often do I need to be re-audited?**

A: Annual audits are recommended. More frequent audits may be required if your AI system changes significantly or if regulators request them.

**Q: What happens if I'm not compliant?**

A: In Europe, fines up to €30 million or 6% of annual revenue. System shutdown orders. Criminal liability for executives. In China, similar penalties. In the US, government procurement restrictions.

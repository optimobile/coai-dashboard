# CIC Revenue Rules Research

## Key Findings from UK Government CIC Guidance

### Can a CIC Charge Enterprises for Services?
**YES - Absolutely allowed.** A CIC operates like any other limited company and can:
- Enter into contracts
- Charge for goods and services
- Generate trading income
- Make profits

The key difference is how profits are used - they must benefit the community, not private shareholders.

### Dividend Cap Rules
- **Maximum 35% of distributable profits** can be paid as dividends
- Remaining 65%+ must be retained for community benefit
- Asset Lock ensures assets are used for community benefit

### Trading Income
- CICs are liable to Corporation Tax on trading profits
- Can earn income through charging for goods/services
- Structure is useful for organizations earning most income through trading

### Community Interest Test
- Must satisfy that activities benefit the community
- Can serve UK or international communities
- Community can be "the population as a whole" or a specific sector

### Key Implications for CSOAI CIC
1. **Enterprise charging is fully legal** - Can charge enterprises for:
   - API access
   - Compliance platform subscriptions
   - Training/certification
   - White-label solutions

2. **65% of profits must go to community benefit** - This aligns perfectly with:
   - Free training giveaways
   - Open-source tools
   - Public Watchdog reports
   - Subsidized certification for individuals

3. **International scope allowed** - Can serve communities abroad (governments, regions without AI safety)

# White-Label Government Solution Research

## The Opportunity: 118 Countries Without AI Governance

According to a 2024 UN report, **118 countries remain excluded from significant international AI governance initiatives**. Only 7 developed nations participate in all existing AI governance frameworks.

### Countries Most Affected (No Formal AI Governance)
- **Africa** - Most nations have no AI safety frameworks
- **Latin America** - Limited AI governance representation
- **Southeast Asia** - Minimal participation in global AI standards
- **Middle East** - Excluded from major governance bodies

### The Problem These Countries Face
1. No input into AI governance frameworks affecting them
2. Pressure to adopt standards designed for different economic contexts
3. Limited infrastructure for AI oversight
4. Regulatory arbitrage opportunities (companies routing through low-oversight jurisdictions)

## Legal Considerations for White-Label Solutions

### Is It Legal for a UK CIC to Sell to Foreign Governments?
**YES** - With some considerations:

1. **Export Controls**: Software is generally not restricted unless it's:
   - Dual-use technology (military applications)
   - Encryption software above certain thresholds
   - Sanctioned countries (Russia, North Korea, etc.)

2. **AI Safety Training/Compliance Software**: NOT restricted because:
   - It's governance/compliance software, not AI itself
   - It helps countries COMPLY with safety standards
   - It's educational/training content

3. **CIC Community Benefit**: Serving international communities is explicitly allowed
   - UK CIC guidance states community can be "abroad"
   - Helping developing nations with AI safety = clear community benefit

### Recommended Structure for Government White-Label

**Tier 1: National AI Safety Authority Package**
- Full platform white-label
- National branding
- Local language support
- Training for government staff
- Pricing: £500,000 - £2,000,000/year

**Tier 2: Regional Consortium Package**
- Multi-country deployment (e.g., African Union, ASEAN)
- Shared infrastructure
- Cross-border incident reporting
- Pricing: £2,000,000 - £10,000,000/year

**Tier 3: Capacity Building Package**
- Training-only deployment
- CEASAI certification for government officials
- No platform, just education
- Pricing: £50,000 - £200,000/year

## Revenue Model That Maintains CIC Compliance

Since 65% of profits must benefit the community:
- Government contracts generate revenue
- 65%+ reinvested into:
  - Free training for citizens of those countries
  - Open-source tools
  - Research and development
  - Subsidized certification for individuals

This creates a **virtuous cycle**: Enterprise/government revenue funds free community programs.

## Timeline Considerations
- UN estimates 5-7 years before enforceable international AI standards
- Countries need solutions NOW before 2026 EU AI Act deadline
- First-mover advantage for CSOAI to become the global standard

# PDCA Methodology Research

## Overview

PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is a four-step improvement cycle based on the scientific method, also known as the Deming Cycle or Shewhart Cycle. It is the foundation of continuous improvement (kaizen) and is integrated into ISO 9001:2015 quality management systems.

## History

1. **Shewhart Cycle (Original)**: Specify → Produce → Inspect
2. **Deming Cycle (1950s Japan)**: Design → Make → Sell → Test
3. **JUSE PDCA (1951)**: Plan → Do → Check → Act

## The Four Phases

### 1. PLAN
**Purpose**: Recognize an opportunity and plan a change

**Key Activities**:
- Determine goals for a process
- Identify needed changes to achieve goals
- Analyze current state/baseline performance
- Define success metrics and targets
- Develop hypothesis for improvement
- Plan data collection methods
- Identify resources required
- Set timeline and milestones

**Outputs**:
- Problem statement
- Root cause analysis
- Proposed countermeasures
- Implementation plan
- Success criteria

### 2. DO
**Purpose**: Test the change through implementation

**Key Activities**:
- Implement the planned changes
- Carry out small-scale study/pilot
- Execute according to plan
- Document what actually happens
- Collect data during implementation
- Note any deviations from plan
- Train involved personnel

**Best Practices**:
- Start small (pilot/test)
- Don't skip to full implementation
- Document everything
- Maintain controlled conditions

### 3. CHECK
**Purpose**: Review the test, analyze results, identify learnings

**Key Activities**:
- Review and analyze collected data
- Compare results against targets
- Evaluate if hypothesis was correct
- Identify what was learned
- Document successes and failures
- Assess unintended consequences
- Verify root cause was addressed

**Key Questions**:
- Did we achieve the target?
- What worked? What didn't?
- Were there unexpected results?
- Is the improvement sustainable?

### 4. ACT
**Purpose**: Take action based on learnings

**Key Activities**:
- **If successful**: Standardize the change
  - Update standard operating procedures
  - Train all relevant personnel
  - Implement across broader scope
  - Document best practices
  
- **If unsuccessful**: Begin cycle again
  - Analyze why it failed
  - Develop new hypothesis
  - Plan different approach
  - Return to PLAN phase

**Standardization**:
- Update standardized work
- Ensure improvement is stable
- Share best practices
- Create new baseline

## ISO 9001:2015 Integration

PDCA is central to ISO 9001:2015 quality management:

### Process Approach + PDCA + Risk-Based Thinking

| Phase | ISO 9001 Application |
|-------|---------------------|
| Plan | Establish objectives, processes, resources needed |
| Do | Implement what was planned |
| Check | Monitor/measure processes against policies, objectives |
| Act | Take actions to improve performance |

### Risk-Based Thinking at Each Stage
- Plan: Identify risks and opportunities
- Do: Implement controls for risks
- Check: Monitor effectiveness of controls
- Act: Improve risk management

## When to Use PDCA

1. Starting a new improvement project
2. Developing new/improved process, product, or service
3. Defining a repetitive work process
4. Planning data collection and analysis
5. Implementing any change
6. Working toward continuous improvement
7. Problem-solving and root cause analysis

## PDCA vs DMAIC Comparison

| PDCA | DMAIC | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Plan | Define, Measure, Analyze | Understand problem, plan solution |
| Do | Improve | Implement solution |
| Check | Control | Verify results |
| Act | Control | Standardize or iterate |

## Best Practices

1. **Don't skip phases** - Each phase builds on the previous
2. **Start small** - Test before full implementation
3. **Use data** - Base decisions on facts, not opinions
4. **Document everything** - Enable learning and replication
5. **Iterate rapidly** - Quick cycles accelerate learning
6. **Involve stakeholders** - Those closest to work have insights
7. **Standardize successes** - Lock in gains before moving on
8. **Learn from failures** - Failed experiments provide valuable data

## Common Pitfalls

1. Jumping from Plan directly to Act (skipping Do and Check)
2. Not establishing clear baseline metrics
3. Implementing too broadly before testing
4. Not documenting learnings
5. Declaring success too early
6. Not standardizing improvements
7. Treating PDCA as one-time vs continuous cycle

## Application to AI Governance

For AI safety and compliance:

| Phase | AI Governance Application |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **Plan** | Identify AI risks, define controls, set compliance targets |
| **Do** | Implement safety measures, deploy controls, train models |
| **Check** | Audit AI systems, measure compliance, assess effectiveness |
| **Act** | Update policies, remediate issues, improve controls |

### AI-Specific Considerations
- Plan: Risk assessment, framework selection, control mapping
- Do: Model testing, safety measures, documentation
- Check: Bias audits, performance monitoring, incident tracking
- Act: Model updates, policy revisions, training improvements

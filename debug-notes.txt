# My Courses Bug Analysis

## Issue:
- The My Courses page shows duplicate "EU AI Act Fundamentals" entries (3 visible)
- Says "7 Total Courses" but only showing duplicates of the same course
- User wants ONLY 7 modules + 2 bundles showing

## Root Cause:
- The getMyEnrollments query returns ALL enrollments for the user
- Multiple enrollments exist for the same course (duplicate enrollments in DB)
- Need to either:
  1. Deduplicate enrollments by courseId in the query
  2. Or filter to show only unique courses

## Solution:
- Modify the MyCourses.tsx to deduplicate enrollments by courseId
- Show only the most recent enrollment per course
- Also need to fix mobile menu UX with clear hamburger/close button

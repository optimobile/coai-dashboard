    "# Introduction to AI Safety",
    "## What is AI Safety?",
    "AI Safety is the field dedicated to ensuring that artificial intelligence systems operate reliably, ethically, and without causing unintended harm to humans or society. As AI becomes more powerful and ubiquitous, the importance of safety measures grows exponentially.",
    "## Why AI Safety Matters",
    "### 1. Preventing Harm",
    "AI systems can make decisions that affect millions of people. A biased hiring algorithm, a flawed medical diagnosis system, or a manipulative recommendation engine can cause significant harm at scale.",
    "### 2. Building Trust",
    "For AI to be widely adopted and beneficial, people need to trust it. Safety measures help build this trust by ensuring AI systems are transparent, fair, and accountable.",
    "### 3. Regulatory Compliance",
    "Governments worldwide are implementing AI regulations. The EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and China's TC260 framework all require organizations to demonstrate AI safety practices.",
    "## The Global Regulatory Landscape",
    "### EU AI Act (2024)",
    "- Risk-based approach: Unacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal risk categories",
    "- Mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems",
    "- Penalties up to €35 million or 7% of global revenue",
    "### NIST AI RMF (USA)",
    "- Voluntary framework with four core functions: GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE",
    "- Focus on trustworthiness characteristics",
    "- Widely adopted by US government and industry",
    "### TC260 (China)",
    "- Comprehensive AI governance framework",
    "- Three-tier risk classification",
    "- 14 governance measures",
    "## Your Role as a Watchdog Analyst",
    "As a COAI Watchdog Analyst, you will:",
    "1. Review AI safety incidents reported by the public",
    "2. Evaluate whether AI systems comply with safety standards",
    "3. Provide human oversight when the 33-agent council cannot reach consensus",
    "4. Contribute to the global effort to make AI safe for humanity",
    "## Key Takeaways",
    "- AI safety is critical for preventing harm and building trust",
    "- Multiple regulatory frameworks exist globally",
    "- Human oversight remains essential even with AI-powered analysis",

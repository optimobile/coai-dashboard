# Viral Growth Execution Plan: 1000 LOI Signups

**Goal:** Convert 1000 LOI signups into 100 paying customers within 90 days

**Current Status:** Production-ready platform, need marketing website + launch strategy

---

## CRITICAL GAP: Marketing Website

**Problem:** Dev server URL (https://3000-i3e8rr9a81bffmpjg9417-d340a7e4.manusvm.computer) links to dashboard backend, not a public marketing site.

**Solution:** Build separate marketing website (like proof.ai) with:
- Public landing page (no login required)
- Hero section with value proposition
- Product screenshots/demo video
- Pricing page
- LOI signup form
- Blog for SEO
- Custom domain (coai.ai)

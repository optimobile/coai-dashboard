# AI Safety Framework for Comoros: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Comoros stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both immense opportunities and significant risks. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a comprehensive AI safety framework in Comoros is not just a strategic advantage but a national imperative. The absence of such a framework exposes Comoros to a range of threats, including data colonialism, algorithmic bias, and economic disenfranchisement. A proactive approach to AI governance will not only mitigate these risks but also position Comoros as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the region, fostering innovation, attracting investment, and ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared by all its citizens. This document outlines a clear and actionable roadmap for Comoros to build a robust AI safety framework, leveraging the expertise and resources of the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) to create a future where AI serves the nation's best interests.

## Current State of AI in Comoros

The digital landscape in Comoros is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the government's ambitious 'Comores Numérique 2028' strategy. This national plan aims to increase the digital sector's contribution to GDP to 5% and create over 5,000 jobs by 2028. While AI adoption is still in its nascent stages, several key sectors are beginning to explore its potential. In finance, AI is being used for credit scoring and risk management in the growing fintech market. The healthcare sector is also seeing early applications of AI in diagnostics and maternal health. Furthermore, the government's commitment to digital public infrastructure, supported by a $10 million grant from the African Development Bank, is laying the groundwork for wider AI integration in public services. However, the lack of a clear regulatory framework and a shortage of skilled AI professionals are significant hurdles that need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of AI in Comoros.

## The AI Governance Gap

Comoros is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a host of risks. Without clear regulations, there is a danger of unchecked AI deployment, leading to potential misuse of personal data, algorithmic bias that could exacerbate social inequalities, and a lack of accountability for AI-driven decisions. For citizens, this could mean a loss of privacy and exposure to unfair or discriminatory practices. For businesses, the absence of a clear legal and ethical framework creates uncertainty, hindering investment and innovation. Moreover, as the world moves towards greater regulation of AI, Comoros risks being left behind, unable to participate fully in the global digital economy. The AI governance gap is not just a policy issue; it is a critical challenge that threatens to undermine Comoros' economic development and social progress.

## CSOAI's Solution for Comoros

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to the specific needs of Comoros. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable system that can be integrated with Comoros' existing legal and regulatory structures. A key component of our solution is the CEASAI Certification, a professional qualification designed to create a local workforce of certified AI Safety Analysts. These analysts will be trained to oversee the ethical development and deployment of AI systems within Comoros. The framework also includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, a decentralized and resilient governance body that ensures a multi-stakeholder approach to AI regulation. Finally, our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a continuous improvement cycle for AI systems, ensuring that they remain safe, fair, and accountable over time.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phase implementation roadmap to build a robust AI safety framework in Comoros:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Comoros' existing digital infrastructure, legal framework, and institutional capacity. We will work closely with government stakeholders to develop a detailed and customized implementation plan.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework, integrating it with Comoros' national systems. This will include the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the necessary legal and regulatory adaptations.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months):** Through our CEASAI certification program, we will train 1,000 Comorian citizens as certified AI Safety Analysts. This will create a local talent pool to support the long-term sustainability of the AI safety framework.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** With the framework deployed and a critical mass of certified analysts trained, Comoros will achieve full operational capability in AI governance. This phase will focus on continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of the AI safety ecosystem.

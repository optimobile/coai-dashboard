## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Serbia to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework is now. As a nation that has already demonstrated its commitment to digital transformation and AI development through its national strategies, Serbia is at a critical juncture. The absence of a robust governance structure for AI exposes the country to significant risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and a lack of accountability, which could stifle innovation and erode public trust. A proactive approach to AI governance will not only mitigate these risks but also position Serbia as a regional leader in responsible AI, attracting investment and fostering a thriving and ethical AI ecosystem. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to accelerate this process, providing a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a proven compliance methodology to ensure Serbia is not just a participant but a leader in the global AI landscape.

## Current State of AI in Serbia

Serbia has made significant strides in embracing artificial intelligence, positioning itself as a regional leader in the digital economy. The Serbian government has been a key driver of this transformation, with its "Leap into the Future 2027" program and the adoption of a new AI strategy for 2025-2030. This strategy builds upon the foundation of the 2019 strategy, which made Serbia the first country in Southeast Europe to establish a comprehensive AI development framework. The government has announced investments of over $70 million in AI and related technologies, with a focus on advancing legislative frameworks, investing in education, fostering innovation and infrastructure, and expanding AI applications in the public sector. These initiatives aim to improve public services, from healthcare and agriculture to electricity generation.

In the private sector, AI adoption is steadily growing, with 34% of companies utilizing AI in their operations. The information, communications, and professional services sectors are leading the charge, with a 60% adoption rate. Financial services, insurance, and real estate are also showing increased uptake of AI technologies. However, the manufacturing sector lags in AI adoption, indicating a need for greater automation and digitalization. While large companies are at the forefront of AI adoption, with 85% having a formalized approach, small and medium-sized enterprises are still in the early stages of their AI journey. The key challenges to wider AI adoption include data quality, integration with existing systems, and a shortage of skilled professionals in areas like machine learning and data analytics. To address this, the government and organizations like the Digital Serbia Initiative are working to foster a vibrant AI ecosystem, supporting startups and promoting AI education and research.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its forward-thinking approach to AI development, Serbia is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This governance gap poses significant risks to both citizens and businesses. Without clear regulations and oversight, the potential for misuse of AI technologies increases, leading to issues such as algorithmic bias in decision-making processes, which can perpetuate and even amplify existing societal inequalities. Furthermore, the lack of a robust data protection framework in the context of AI can lead to serious privacy violations, eroding public trust in both government and private sector institutions. For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory landscape creates uncertainty, hindering long-term investment and innovation in AI. Companies may be hesitant to develop and deploy new AI solutions without clear guidelines on what is permissible, fearing potential legal and reputational damage. This can stifle the growth of the local AI ecosystem and put Serbian businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global market. The EU's AI Act, with its fast-approaching deadline, further underscores the urgency for Serbia to establish its own AI governance framework to ensure seamless integration with the European single market.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Serbia, ensuring a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Serbia's existing AI landscape, including a review of current regulations, an analysis of the key industries using AI, and an identification of the specific risks and opportunities. This will be followed by the development of a detailed implementation plan, tailored to Serbia's unique context.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, the white-label AI Safety Framework will be deployed and customized to meet Serbia's specific needs. This will involve the establishment of the necessary institutional structures, the development of specific guidelines and standards, and the integration of the framework with existing government systems.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (Ongoing):** To ensure the long-term sustainability of the AI governance framework, CSOAI will launch a nationwide training program to certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts. This will create a pool of qualified professionals who can support the implementation and ongoing management of the framework.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** In the final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with all the necessary institutional structures, processes, and personnel in place. This will be followed by a continuous process of monitoring, evaluation, and improvement to ensure that the framework remains effective and responsive to the evolving AI landscape.

# AI Safety Framework for Eswatini: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Eswatini stands at a critical juncture. The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity for the nation's economy and society. However, to harness this potential responsibly, a robust AI safety framework is not just an option, but a necessity. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Eswatini to establish its own AI governance is now. A proactive approach will not only mitigate potential risks but also position Eswatini as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the region, fostering trust and attracting investment. This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for Eswatini to build a resilient and ethical AI ecosystem, ensuring that the development and deployment of AI align with the nation's values and priorities.

## Current State of AI in Eswatini

Eswatini is in the early stages of a digital transformation, with the government actively seeking to leverage technology for economic growth and improved public services. While AI adoption is still nascent, there is a growing recognition of its potential across various sectors. The financial industry, for instance, is exploring AI for applications such as risk management, fraud detection, and personalized customer services. Similarly, the export sector is looking at AI-powered tools to enhance trade and logistics. The government's partnership with Google to drive digital transformation and the establishment of a Digital Government Implementation Roadmap are clear indicators of the country's commitment to embracing the digital age. However, challenges remain, including limited broadband access in rural areas and the need to upskill the workforce to meet the demands of an AI-driven economy. The AI Indaba, a UN-supported initiative, brought together stakeholders to discuss how AI can be harnessed for sustainable development, addressing key national challenges in youth unemployment, health, and agriculture. These initiatives, while promising, highlight the need for a coordinated and strategic approach to AI development and governance.

## The AI Governance Gap

Eswatini is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks associated with the unchecked proliferation of AI technologies. Without clear regulations and oversight, there is a potential for biased algorithms to perpetuate and even amplify existing societal inequalities, particularly in areas such as hiring, lending, and law enforcement. Furthermore, the absence of a framework can lead to a lack of accountability when AI systems fail or cause harm, eroding public trust in both technology and governance. For businesses, the uncertainty created by this regulatory vacuum can stifle innovation and deter investment, as companies may be hesitant to deploy AI solutions without clear legal and ethical guidelines. The personal data of citizens is also at risk, as there are no specific regulations to govern the collection, use, and storage of data by AI systems. This can lead to privacy breaches and the misuse of sensitive information. To ensure that AI is a force for good in Eswatini, it is imperative that this governance gap is addressed urgently.

## CSOAI's Solution for Eswatini

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to Eswatini's specific needs and cultural context. This is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a partnership to build a sustainable and responsible AI ecosystem. Our framework is built on three core pillars:

**1. CEASAI Certification:** The Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation (CEASAI) program is designed to create a local pool of skilled professionals who can lead the implementation and oversight of AI systems. By training and certifying Eswatini's own citizens, we ensure that the nation has the in-house expertise to manage its AI journey independently and effectively.

**2. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** To ensure robust and unbiased oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This decentralized governance model is inspired by the Byzantine Generals' Problem and is designed to be resilient to individual failures or malicious actors. The council would be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry experts, academics, and civil society representatives, who would work together to set ethical guidelines, review high-risk AI applications, and ensure that AI is deployed in a manner that is aligned with Eswatini's national interests.

**3. SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI safety and compliance. This continuous improvement cycle allows organizations to systematically identify and mitigate risks, adapt to evolving threats, and ensure that their AI systems remain safe, reliable, and trustworthy over time. The methodology is designed to be practical and easy to implement, enabling businesses of all sizes to adopt best practices in AI governance without the need for extensive resources or expertise.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a four-phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Eswatini, designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition to a regulated AI environment.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** The initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Eswatini's existing digital infrastructure, legal and regulatory landscape, and technical capacity. This will be a collaborative effort, working closely with government ministries, regulatory bodies, and key industry stakeholders to identify specific needs, challenges, and opportunities. The outcome of this phase will be a detailed and customized implementation plan that is aligned with Eswatini's national development goals.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, the tailored AI Safety Framework will be deployed. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, the adoption of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology, and the development of specific guidelines and standards for high-risk AI applications. A key focus of this phase will be on building institutional capacity, ensuring that the relevant government agencies and regulatory bodies have the necessary tools and resources to effectively oversee the AI ecosystem.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (Ongoing):** The long-term success of the framework depends on the availability of a skilled local workforce. Through the CEASAI certification program, we will train 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Eswatini. This will create a sustainable pool of talent that can support the ongoing implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the framework, as well as provide expert advice to both the public and private sectors.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** The final phase will see the AI Safety Framework become fully operational. This will involve the continuous monitoring of the AI landscape, the regular review and updating of the framework to address emerging challenges and technologies, and the ongoing training and professional development of AI safety professionals. The goal is to create a dynamic and adaptive governance system that can keep pace with the rapid evolution of AI.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building global AI safety capacity, CSOAI is proud to announce a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals worldwide, and the citizens of Eswatini are invited to be a part of this transformative opportunity. By removing the financial barriers to high-quality AI safety training, we aim to empower a new generation of experts who can lead the charge for responsible AI in their own communities and countries. This is not just about creating jobs; it is about building a global network of professionals who are committed to ensuring that AI is developed and deployed in a manner that is safe, ethical, and beneficial to all of humanity. For Eswatini, this means the immediate creation of a skilled workforce that can support the nation's AI ambitions, drive innovation, and ensure that the benefits of AI are shared by all.

# AI Safety Framework for Cameroon: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Cameroon stands at a critical juncture in its digital transformation journey. With the rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the nation has a time-sensitive opportunity to establish a robust AI safety framework. The impending deadline of the European Union's AI Act in February 2026 makes this an immediate priority. Cameroonian businesses and innovators targeting the European market will need to comply with these stringent regulations, and the absence of a national framework will create significant barriers to trade and innovation. A proactive approach to AI governance will not only mitigate risks but also unlock the immense potential of AI to drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve the lives of Cameroonian citizens. This is the moment for Cameroon to build a future-proof AI ecosystem grounded in safety, ethics, and inclusivity, ensuring that the nation is not just a consumer but a competitive producer of AI technologies on the global stage.

## The Current State of AI in Cameroon

Cameroon is progressively embracing the potential of Artificial Intelligence, with adoption steadily increasing across various sectors. The government's forward-looking digital transformation initiatives have laid the groundwork for this technological shift. In July 2025, Cameroon launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (SNIA), a comprehensive roadmap designed to position the country as a leading AI hub in Africa. The strategy ambitiously aims to train 60,000 AI professionals, create 12,000 direct jobs, and contribute up to 1.2% to the nation's GDP by 2040. This demonstrates a clear commitment to harnessing AI for national development.

Key industries are already beginning to leverage AI to enhance efficiency and productivity. In agriculture, AI-powered mobile applications are helping farmers to detect crop diseases, identify pests, and receive tailored advice for improving yields. This is particularly impactful for small-scale farmers who form the backbone of Cameroon's agricultural sector. The healthcare industry is also witnessing a significant transformation. AI is being deployed to improve disease diagnosis, with AI-powered tools assisting in the early detection of life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and tuberculosis. Furthermore, telemedicine platforms and AI-driven chatbots are expanding access to healthcare services, especially in rural and underserved communities.

Cameroon's legal framework for technology is also evolving. The country has enacted laws on cybersecurity and cybercrime (Law No. 2010/012) and electronic commerce (Law No. 2010/021). More recently, a comprehensive Data Protection Law (No. 2024/017) was introduced in December 2024, with a compliance deadline of June 2026. This new law, which incorporates principles similar to the GDPR, signals a growing awareness of the importance of data privacy in the digital age. However, despite these positive steps, a specific governance framework for AI is yet to be established, creating a critical gap that needs to be addressed to ensure the responsible and ethical development of AI in the country.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its ambitious goals for AI adoption, Cameroon is one of 118 countries that currently lack a dedicated AI governance framework. This significant gap is highlighted by the nation's low score of 4.04 out of 100 on the Global AI Readiness Index (GIRAI), where it ranks 97th globally. The absence of a specific AI governance framework is a major contributing factor to this low ranking, earning the country a score of zero in that particular category. While the government has taken some initial steps towards digital transformation and data protection, the lack of a comprehensive AI policy creates a precarious environment for both citizens and businesses.

The risks associated with this governance vacuum are substantial. Without clear ethical guidelines and legal standards, the development and deployment of AI systems can lead to a host of problems. Biased algorithms, trained on incomplete or skewed data, can perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities in areas such as hiring, loan applications, and criminal justice. The rapid automation of tasks through AI could also lead to significant job displacement, and without a national strategy for reskilling and upskilling the workforce, this could result in widespread economic disruption. Furthermore, the absence of clear lines of accountability makes it difficult to address grievances and seek redress when AI systems cause harm.

For Cameroonian businesses, the lack of a national AI framework creates uncertainty and hinders their ability to compete on the global stage. As international regulations like the EU AI Act become the norm, companies in Cameroon will find it increasingly difficult to export their products and services without being able to demonstrate compliance. This not only limits their market access but also stifles innovation, as businesses may be hesitant to invest in AI without a clear and predictable regulatory environment. Ultimately, the AI governance gap is not just a matter of policy; it is a fundamental barrier to unlocking the full potential of AI for sustainable and equitable development in Cameroon.

## CSOAI's Solution for Cameroon

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Cameroon's AI governance gap and accelerate its journey towards becoming a leader in responsible AI. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy regulatory and technical infrastructure that can be adapted to Cameroon's specific needs and cultural context. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and scalable system that empowers the Cameroonian government to establish its own sovereign AI governance, aligned with international best practices and standards such as the EU AI Act.

At the heart of our solution is the Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation (CEASAI) program. This world-class certification is designed to rapidly build local capacity by training a new generation of AI safety professionals in Cameroon. The CEASAI curriculum covers all aspects of AI safety, from technical principles of explainability and bias detection to the legal and ethical dimensions of AI governance. By equipping local talent with these critical skills, we can ensure that Cameroon has the human capital necessary to build, manage, and regulate its own AI ecosystem.

To ensure robust and impartial oversight, our framework includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This innovative governance model is inspired by the principles of Byzantine fault tolerance, a concept from computer science that ensures the reliability of a system even when some of its components fail or act maliciously. The council would be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry experts, academics, civil society representatives, and international partners. This multi-stakeholder approach ensures that a wide range of perspectives are considered in the decision-making process, preventing any single entity from having undue influence and fostering a more democratic and accountable AI governance structure.

Compliance and continuous improvement are managed through our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology. This iterative, four-stage management cycle provides a structured approach for organizations to achieve and maintain compliance with AI safety standards. The SOAI-PDCA cycle involves planning for AI safety, implementing the plan, checking the results, and acting on what has been learned. This continuous feedback loop ensures that Cameroon's AI governance framework remains agile and responsive to the rapidly evolving technological landscape, allowing for ongoing improvement and adaptation over time.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Cameroon, designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition towards full operational capability. This four-phase roadmap is structured to deliver tangible results at each stage, building a solid foundation for a sustainable and responsible AI ecosystem.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Cameroon's existing digital infrastructure, legal and regulatory landscape, and human capital. Working in close collaboration with government ministries, regulatory bodies, and industry stakeholders, we will identify the specific needs and priorities for AI governance in Cameroon. This will culminate in the development of a detailed and customized implementation plan, outlining the key milestones, timelines, and resource requirements for the successful deployment of the AI Safety Framework.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

Following the assessment and planning phase, we will proceed with the deployment of the white-label AI Safety Framework. This will involve the technical setup of the necessary infrastructure, including the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. The legal and regulatory components of the framework will be adapted and integrated into Cameroon's existing legal system, ensuring a seamless and coherent governance structure. During this phase, we will also work with key government agencies to pilot the framework in selected sectors, allowing for real-world testing and refinement.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

Building local capacity is a cornerstone of our approach. In this phase, we will launch a nationwide training program to certify 1,000 Cameroonian professionals as AI Safety Analysts through our CEASAI program. This intensive training will equip them with the skills and knowledge to manage, audit, and ensure the safety and compliance of AI systems across all sectors. This will create a self-sustaining pool of local talent, reducing reliance on foreign expertise and fostering a vibrant domestic AI industry.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

The final phase will see the AI Safety Framework become fully operational across Cameroon. The newly trained AI Safety Analysts will be deployed to various government agencies and private sector organizations, ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in a safe and ethical manner. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI will be fully functional, providing ongoing oversight and guidance. At this stage, Cameroon will have a robust and resilient AI governance ecosystem, positioning it as a regional leader in responsible AI.

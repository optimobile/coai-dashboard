# AI Safety Framework for Trinidad and Tobago: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Trinidad and Tobago stands at a critical juncture. As the world accelerates towards an AI-driven future, the nation has demonstrated a clear commitment to digital transformation, marked by the establishment of a dedicated Ministry of Public Administration and Artificial Intelligence and the launch of a national AI readiness assessment. However, with the European Union's AI Act set to take effect on February 2, 2026, the window of opportunity to establish a robust AI safety and governance framework is closing. The absence of such a framework exposes Trinidad and Tobago to significant risks, including economic disadvantages, erosion of public trust, and a failure to harness the full potential of AI for national development. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label solution designed to bridge this governance gap, providing the tools, training, and oversight necessary to ensure that AI is deployed safely, ethically, and for the benefit of all citizens. This is a pivotal moment for Trinidad and Tobago to not only mitigate the risks of AI but also to position itself as a leader in responsible AI adoption within the Caribbean.

## The Current State of AI in Trinidad and Tobago

Trinidad and Tobago is actively embracing the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, with the government leading the charge in fostering a national ecosystem for AI innovation and adoption. The establishment of the Ministry of Public Administration and Artificial Intelligence signals a strong political will to integrate AI into the fabric of the nation's development. This commitment is further underscored by the launch of a comprehensive National AI Readiness Assessment in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNESCO. This initiative aims to evaluate the country's preparedness for the ethical and inclusive adoption of AI, a crucial step in building a robust governance framework.

Key industries in Trinidad and Tobago are beginning to explore and implement AI technologies to enhance efficiency and drive growth. The finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics sectors are at the forefront of this adoption, leveraging AI for everything from fraud detection and medical diagnostics to supply chain optimization. The government's digital transformation initiatives, such as the deployment of the AI-powered national digital assistant, "Anansi," and the country's membership in the "50 in 5" global initiative, are creating a fertile ground for AI to flourish. However, the regulatory landscape is still evolving. While Trinidad and Tobago has a Data Protection Act (2011) and a National Cyber Security Strategy (2012), there is currently no specific legislation governing the use of AI. This regulatory gap highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive AI safety framework to guide the country's journey into the AI age.

## The AI Governance Gap

Trinidad and Tobago is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap poses significant risks to the nation's economic and social fabric. Without a clear set of rules and standards for the development and deployment of AI, Trinidad and Tobago is vulnerable to a range of negative consequences. For citizens, the absence of AI governance can lead to the erosion of privacy, algorithmic bias, and a lack of accountability for AI-driven decisions. For businesses, the lack of a clear regulatory environment creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and can lead to a loss of competitiveness in the global market.

The impending deadline of the EU AI Act further exacerbates these risks. As one of the world's most comprehensive pieces of AI legislation, the EU AI Act will have a far-reaching impact on countries that do business with the European Union. Trinidad and Tobago's businesses that fail to comply with the Act's requirements could face significant barriers to trade and investment. The AI governance gap is not just a matter of regulatory compliance; it is a matter of national security, economic prosperity, and social well-being. It is imperative that Trinidad and Tobago acts now to close this gap and build a future where AI is a force for good.

## CSOAI's Solution for Trinidad and Tobago

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to address Trinidad and Tobago's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a comprehensive set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be tailored to the specific needs of the country. The framework is designed to be fully compliant with international standards, including the EU AI Act, ensuring that Trinidad and Tobago can seamlessly integrate into the global digital economy.

At the heart of our solution is the Certified AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program, a rigorous training and certification program designed to create a local workforce of AI safety experts. Through our £1 billion training giveaway, we are offering free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts globally, including the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago. This initiative will create immediate capacity within the country to oversee the safe and ethical deployment of AI.

To ensure robust oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, an independent body of experts responsible for monitoring the AI landscape and providing guidance to the government. This council, combined with our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, will provide a continuous cycle of improvement, ensuring that Trinidad and Tobago's AI governance framework remains effective and up-to-date.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a four-phase implementation roadmap to deploy our AI Safety Framework in Trinidad and Tobago:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** In this phase, we will work closely with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to conduct a detailed assessment of the country's specific needs and priorities. This will involve a series of workshops and consultations with key stakeholders from government, industry, and civil society.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** Based on the findings of the assessment and planning phase, we will deploy our white-label AI Safety Framework, customizing it to the unique context of Trinidad and Tobago.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** Through our CEASAI program, we will train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Trinidad and Tobago, creating a local pool of talent to support the implementation and oversight of the framework.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In this final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI providing ongoing oversight and guidance.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

CSOAI is committed to democratizing access to AI safety expertise. Through our £1 billion training giveaway, we are offering free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals worldwide. Citizens of Trinidad and Tobago are invited to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to become certified AI Safety Analysts. This program will not only create a new generation of skilled professionals but also provide the immediate capacity needed to implement and manage a national AI safety framework. By empowering its citizens with the knowledge and skills to navigate the complexities of AI, Trinidad and Tobago can ensure that the benefits of this transformative technology are shared by all.

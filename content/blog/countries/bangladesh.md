# AI Safety Framework for Bangladesh: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Bangladesh to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. The nation stands at a critical juncture, where the decisions made today will shape its technological future and economic trajectory for decades to come. Without a robust governance structure, Bangladesh risks falling behind in the global digital economy, exposing its citizens and businesses to a myriad of risks, including data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and economic disruption. The rapid proliferation of AI technologies necessitates a proactive, rather than reactive, approach to regulation. A national AI safety framework will not only mitigate these risks but also foster an environment of trust and innovation, enabling Bangladesh to harness the full potential of AI for sustainable development. The time to act is now; the cost of inaction is a future defined by technological dependency and missed opportunities.

## Current State of AI in Bangladesh

Bangladesh has made significant strides in its journey towards a "Digital Bangladesh," with AI adoption steadily increasing across various sectors. The government's commitment to digital transformation has laid the groundwork for a burgeoning AI ecosystem. Key industries, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and the ready-made garment (RMG) sector, are beginning to leverage AI to enhance efficiency, productivity, and innovation. In healthcare, AI-powered diagnostics are improving access to quality medical services in remote areas. In agriculture, AI is being used for crop monitoring and yield prediction, helping to ensure food security. The financial sector is employing AI for fraud detection and credit scoring, while the RMG industry is exploring AI-driven automation to maintain its competitive edge. 

Several government initiatives, such as the Aspire to Innovate (a2i) Programme, are driving the adoption of digital services and fostering a culture of innovation. The "Digital Bangladesh" vision has been instrumental in creating a favorable environment for technological advancement. However, the existing regulatory landscape has not kept pace with the rapid advancements in AI. While there are general laws related to information and communication technology, there is no specific legislation or policy framework dedicated to AI governance. This regulatory gap poses significant challenges to ensuring the responsible and ethical development and deployment of AI in the country. The absence of a clear legal and ethical framework for AI not only exposes citizens to potential harm but also creates uncertainty for businesses and investors, hindering the long-term growth of the AI sector in Bangladesh.

## The AI Governance Gap

Bangladesh is one of 118 countries, primarily in the Global South, that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This "AI governance gap" leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks that could have profound and lasting consequences for its citizens and economy. Without a guiding framework, the development and deployment of AI systems can occur in a regulatory vacuum, leading to a host of problems. For citizens, this could mean the erosion of privacy as personal data is collected and used without adequate safeguards. Algorithmic bias in AI systems used for everything from loan applications to job recruitment could perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities. The lack of transparency and accountability in AI decision-making processes can undermine public trust and lead to a sense of powerlessness.

For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory framework creates an unpredictable and unstable environment. Companies may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies without clear rules of the road, stifling innovation and economic growth. Furthermore, without a national AI strategy, Bangladesh risks becoming a passive consumer of AI technologies developed elsewhere, rather than an active participant in the global AI ecosystem. This could lead to a new form of digital colonialism, where the country's digital future is shaped by foreign powers and corporations. The AI governance gap is not just a matter of policy; it is a matter of national sovereignty and economic self-determination.

## CSOAI's Solution for Bangladesh

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to meet the specific needs and context of Bangladesh. Our solution is designed to be a turnkey, national-scale platform that empowers countries to build a robust and resilient AI governance ecosystem. At the core of our offering is the CEASAI Certification, a professional credential for AI Safety Analysts. This certification program is designed to create a pipeline of local talent, ensuring that Bangladesh has the skilled workforce needed to oversee the safe and ethical development of AI.

Our framework is built upon a unique governance model: the 33-Agent Byzantine Council. This decentralized, fault-tolerant system provides a robust mechanism for AI oversight, ensuring that no single point of failure can compromise the integrity of the system. The Council is composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government representatives, industry experts, academics, and civil society organizations, ensuring a balanced and inclusive approach to AI governance.

To ensure compliance with the highest international standards, our framework incorporates the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology. This iterative, four-stage management cycle provides a structured approach to continuous improvement, enabling Bangladesh to adapt its AI governance framework as new challenges and opportunities emerge. The SOAI-PDCA methodology ensures that the framework remains relevant, effective, and aligned with global best practices. By adopting the CSOAI solution, Bangladesh can leapfrog the AI governance gap and position itself as a leader in responsible AI.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a phased implementation roadmap to ensure a smooth and successful deployment of the AI Safety Framework in Bangladesh. The roadmap is designed to be completed within a 12-month timeframe, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Bangladesh's existing AI landscape, including its legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks. We will work closely with government officials, industry stakeholders, and civil society organizations to identify the country's specific needs and priorities. Based on this assessment, we will develop a detailed implementation plan that is tailored to the unique context of Bangladesh.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In the second phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework, including the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. We will work with local partners to customize the framework to align with Bangladesh's national development goals and cultural values. This phase will also involve the establishment of the necessary institutional structures to support the long-term sustainability of the framework.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

The third phase will focus on building local capacity by training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts through our CEASAI Certification program. This intensive training program will equip local professionals with the skills and knowledge needed to oversee the safe and ethical development of AI in Bangladesh.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

The final phase will involve the transition to full operational capability, with the AI Safety Framework fully integrated into Bangladesh's national governance structures. We will provide ongoing support and technical assistance to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the framework.

# AI Safety Framework for Sierra Leone: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Sierra Leone to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been more critical. The nation stands at a pivotal juncture, where proactive and strategic adoption of AI governance can unlock unprecedented economic growth and social development. Failure to act swiftly could result in significant risks, including the proliferation of unsafe AI systems, erosion of public trust, and exclusion from the global digital economy. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution for Sierra Leone to not just meet but exceed global standards in AI safety and governance. Our white-label AI Safety Framework, combined with the CEASAI Certification for local professionals and the innovative 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, provides a clear and actionable path for Sierra Leone to become a leader in responsible AI adoption in Africa. This is a critical moment for Sierra Leone to build a future-proof, human-centric AI ecosystem that drives inclusive and sustainable progress for all its citizens.

## The Current State of AI in Sierra Leone

Sierra Leone is in the nascent stages of an AI-powered transformation, demonstrating a clear commitment to leveraging digital technologies for national development. The government, in partnership with international organizations like the World Bank and UNICEF, has launched several initiatives to explore and harness the potential of artificial intelligence. A landmark development is the recent launch of a national AI readiness assessment, a crucial first step in formulating a comprehensive National AI Strategy. This proactive stance signals a recognition of AI's potential to revolutionize key sectors of the economy and improve public service delivery.

Key industries are beginning to explore AI applications to enhance efficiency and drive innovation. In the **financial sector**, AI is being used for credit scoring, fraud detection, and personalized banking services. The **agriculture sector**, a cornerstone of Sierra Leone's economy, is seeing the potential of AI in crop monitoring, pest detection, and yield optimization. In **healthcare**, AI-powered diagnostic tools and telemedicine platforms are being piloted to improve access to quality healthcare, particularly in remote areas. The education sector is also embracing AI, with initiatives like the AI-powered "Teacher Lemp Lemp" platform aimed at improving learning outcomes.

The government's digital transformation agenda is a key driver of AI adoption. The establishment of the Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation (DSTI) underscores the government's commitment to fostering a culture of innovation. Initiatives to expand internet connectivity, promote digital literacy, and create a vibrant tech ecosystem are laying the groundwork for a thriving AI landscape. While Sierra Leone is yet to enact specific AI legislation, existing technology regulations and policies provide a foundation for building a robust AI governance framework. The country's proactive and purpose-driven approach to AI adoption, focused on addressing local challenges and promoting inclusive growth, positions it to become a regional leader in responsible AI.

## The AI Governance Gap

Sierra Leone is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This "AI governance gap" presents significant risks to the nation's economic and social fabric. Without clear regulations and oversight mechanisms, the development and deployment of AI systems can lead to a host of problems, including algorithmic bias, job displacement, and the erosion of privacy. For citizens, the absence of a governance framework means a lack of protection against the potential harms of AI, from discriminatory loan applications to the spread of misinformation. For businesses, the lack of clear rules creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and hinders their ability to compete in the global marketplace.

The risks of inaction are particularly acute in the context of the rapidly evolving global regulatory landscape. The EU AI Act, with its stringent requirements for AI safety and ethics, is set to become a global benchmark. Countries without comparable frameworks will face significant barriers to trade and investment, effectively being locked out of the world's largest single market. For Sierra Leone, a nation with aspirations of becoming a regional tech hub, this is a risk it cannot afford to take. Closing the AI governance gap is not just a matter of compliance; it is a strategic imperative for ensuring that AI is a force for good, driving inclusive and sustainable development for all Sierra Leoneans.

## CSOAI's Solution for Sierra Leone

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to help Sierra Leone bridge the AI governance gap and establish itself as a leader in responsible AI. Our offerings are designed to be implemented quickly and efficiently, providing a clear path to a future-proof AI ecosystem.

At the core of our solution is the **White-label AI Safety Framework**, a ready-to-deploy governance structure that can be tailored to Sierra Leone's specific needs and priorities. This framework provides a comprehensive set of policies, standards, and best practices for the development, deployment, and use of AI systems. It covers everything from data privacy and security to algorithmic transparency and accountability, ensuring that AI is used in a way that is safe, ethical, and aligned with Sierra Leonean values.

To build local capacity and ensure the long-term sustainability of the framework, we offer the **CEASAI Certification**, a globally recognized qualification for AI safety professionals. Through our partnership with leading educational institutions, we can train a new generation of AI Safety Analysts in Sierra Leone, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to oversee the implementation of the AI Safety Framework and ensure compliance with international standards.

For robust and independent oversight, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**. This innovative governance model, inspired by the principles of Byzantine fault tolerance, brings together a diverse group of stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society to provide independent oversight of the AI ecosystem. The Council's decentralized structure ensures that no single entity can control the AI governance process, promoting transparency, accountability, and public trust.

Finally, our **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** provides a structured and iterative approach to AI governance. This methodology enables organizations to continuously assess their AI systems, identify and mitigate risks, and improve their AI safety and compliance posture over time. By adopting the SOAI-PDCA methodology, Sierra Leone can ensure that its AI governance framework remains agile, effective, and responsive to the ever-changing technological landscape.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a four-phase implementation roadmap to guide Sierra Leone on its journey to full AI operational capability. This roadmap is designed to be completed within a 12-month timeframe, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase involves a comprehensive assessment of Sierra Leone's existing digital infrastructure, legal and regulatory landscape, and institutional capacity. This assessment will inform the customization of the AI Safety Framework and the development of a detailed implementation plan. Key activities in this phase include stakeholder consultations, policy analysis, and the establishment of a national AI task force.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In the second phase, the customized AI Safety Framework will be deployed across government and key industries. This will involve the development of new policies and regulations, the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, and the launch of a public awareness campaign to educate citizens and businesses about the new framework.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

The third phase focuses on building local capacity through the training and certification of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts. This will be achieved through a combination of online and in-person training programs, delivered in partnership with local universities and training institutions. The goal is to create a sustainable pool of local talent to support the long-term implementation of the AI Safety Framework.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

The final phase marks the transition to full operational capability. By this stage, the AI Safety Framework will be fully integrated into Sierra Leone's legal and regulatory system, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI will be fully operational, and a critical mass of certified AI Safety Analysts will be in place to ensure ongoing compliance and oversight. This will position Sierra Leone as a regional leader in responsible AI, attracting investment, fostering innovation, and driving inclusive and sustainable growth.

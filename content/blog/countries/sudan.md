# AI Safety Framework for Sudan: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

In an era where artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping our world, the urgency for robust AI governance has never been more critical. For Sudan, a nation at a pivotal juncture in its development, the establishment of a comprehensive AI safety framework is not just a strategic advantage but a national imperative. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Sudan to act is now. The absence of a national AI strategy places Sudan among 118 countries at risk of being left behind in the global digital economy, vulnerable to the multifaceted threats of unregulated AI. This includes the amplification of misinformation and disinformation, which has already been witnessed in the ongoing conflict. A proactive approach to AI governance will not only mitigate these risks but also unlock the immense potential of AI to drive economic growth, enhance public services, and foster innovation. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this governance gap, providing a clear roadmap for Sudan to build a resilient and responsible AI ecosystem.

## The Current State of AI in Sudan

Sudan's engagement with artificial intelligence is a study in contrasts. On one hand, the nation is grappling with a severe humanitarian crisis and an ongoing conflict where AI-powered disinformation has been weaponized, fueling violence and obstructing aid. Reports from organizations like the CDAC Network have highlighted how AI-generated content is used to spread false narratives and incite violence. This malicious use of AI underscores the dark side of unregulated technology and the urgent need for a governance framework.

On the other hand, there are nascent signs of AI adoption and a growing recognition of its potential for positive transformation. The Sudanese government has taken initial steps towards digital transformation by establishing the Digital Transformation Authority, the Sudanese Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority, and the Sudanese Cybersecurity Authority. These bodies are tasked with laying the groundwork for a modern digital state, but they face significant challenges, including political instability, limited infrastructure, and a lack of specialized expertise. Sudan's AI preparedness score of 24.63 out of 100, as rated by Oxford Insights in 2024, lags behind the sub-Saharan African average of 32.70, highlighting the long road ahead.

Despite these challenges, there are pockets of innovation. In sectors like agriculture, healthcare, and education, AI is beginning to make inroads. For instance, the DARAJA+AI for Sudan project, which won the TECH4Resilience Challenge, aims to use AI to improve the accuracy and accessibility of life-saving weather alerts for farmers. In the humanitarian sector, AI is being explored for needs assessments and to make aid delivery more efficient. However, the AI community in Sudan remains fragmented, and there is a clear need for a national strategy to unify efforts and guide the responsible development and deployment of AI.

## The AI Governance Gap

Sudan is one of 118 countries that have not yet developed a national AI strategy or governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks, with significant implications for its citizens and businesses. The absence of a regulatory framework means there are no safeguards to prevent the misuse of AI, as seen in the proliferation of deepfakes and disinformation that have exacerbated the ongoing conflict. This not only fuels instability but also erodes public trust in information and institutions.

For Sudanese citizens, the lack of AI governance translates to a lack of protection for their data and digital rights. Without clear regulations on data privacy and security, individuals are at risk of having their personal information exploited. Furthermore, the absence of a framework for ethical AI development means that biased algorithms could perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities.

For businesses, the AI governance gap creates an environment of uncertainty. Without clear rules of the road, companies are hesitant to invest in and adopt AI technologies, stifling innovation and economic growth. Moreover, as international regulations like the EU AI Act come into force, Sudanese businesses that are not compliant will face significant barriers to accessing global markets. The lack of a national AI strategy also means that Sudan is missing out on the opportunity to attract foreign investment and build a competitive AI ecosystem.

## CSOAI's Solution for Sudan

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to help nations like Sudan rapidly establish robust AI governance. Our solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a customizable framework that can be adapted to Sudan's specific needs and context. The framework is built on four key pillars:

1.  **White-label AI Safety Framework:** CSOAI provides a ready-to-deploy legal and technical framework that covers all aspects of AI governance, from data protection and privacy to algorithmic transparency and accountability. This framework is designed to be compliant with international standards, including the EU AI Act, ensuring that Sudan can seamlessly integrate into the global digital economy.

2.  **CEASAI Certification:** A critical component of our solution is the Certified AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program. This program is designed to build local capacity by training and certifying a new generation of AI safety professionals in Sudan. These certified analysts will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to oversee the implementation of the AI safety framework, conduct audits of AI systems, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

3.  **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** To ensure robust and impartial oversight, CSOAI proposes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry experts, academics, and civil society representatives, will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the AI safety framework and making key decisions on AI policy.

4.  **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** Our framework is underpinned by the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology. This iterative, risk-based approach enables organizations to continuously assess and improve their AI systems, ensuring that they remain safe, reliable, and aligned with ethical principles.

By adopting CSOAI's solution, Sudan can leapfrog the lengthy and complex process of developing an AI governance framework from scratch. Our turnkey solution provides a clear and actionable roadmap for Sudan to build a resilient and responsible AI ecosystem, paving the way for a future where AI is a force for good.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a four-phase implementation roadmap to guide Sudan in the deployment of its national AI safety framework:

# AI Safety Framework for Kazakhstan: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Kazakhstan is at a critical juncture. As a regional leader in AI readiness, the nation has already taken the proactive step of introducing its own AI law, becoming the second jurisdiction in the world to do so after the European Union. However, with the EU's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time to implement a comprehensive and robust AI safety framework is now. Without a clear and actionable framework, Kazakhstan risks falling behind, exposing its citizens and businesses to the potential harms of unchecked AI. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution: a white-label AI Safety Framework, complete with professional certification, a unique oversight model, and a proven compliance methodology. This is a pivotal moment for Kazakhstan to not only align with global standards but to solidify its position as a true leader in the digital age.

## Current State of AI in Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan has made significant strides in its digital transformation journey, with AI adoption and usage steadily increasing across various sectors. The government's commitment to digitalization is evident in initiatives like the "Digital Kazakhstan" program and the recent launch of a global program to assess the readiness of public organizations for open-source solutions. This forward-thinking approach has positioned Kazakhstan as a regional leader, ranking 60th out of 195 countries in the 2025 Government AI Readiness Index. Key industries are already leveraging AI to drive innovation and efficiency. The Industrial AI Accelerator program, for instance, is actively introducing AI solutions in mining, energy and oil production (EnergyTech), medical technologies (MedTech), financial technologies (FinTech), and government technologies (GovTech). This widespread adoption, coupled with the recent enactment of a national AI law, demonstrates a clear understanding of AI's transformative potential. However, the rapid pace of technological advancement also brings challenges, including a shortage of skilled AI specialists. As Kazakhstan continues to build its digital ecosystem, the need for a robust governance framework to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI has never been more critical.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its commendable progress, Kazakhstan, like many other nations, faces an AI governance gap. While the new AI law provides a foundational legal framework, it does not, on its own, constitute a comprehensive governance and safety regime. The law outlines what needs to be done, but the "how" remains a critical question. Without a clear implementation and oversight framework, the risks associated with AI—from algorithmic bias and data privacy violations to the spread of misinformation and the potential for malicious use—remain largely unaddressed. This gap leaves citizens vulnerable and businesses uncertain about their compliance obligations. For Kazakhstan to fully realize the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks, it must move beyond legislation to implementation. This means establishing clear standards, building local capacity, and creating a robust oversight mechanism. The absence of such a framework not only exposes the country to internal risks but also hinders its ability to engage with the global AI ecosystem on an equal footing.

## CSOAI's Solution for Kazakhstan

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to bridge the governance gap in Kazakhstan. Our solution is not just a set of guidelines; it's a complete ecosystem for building a safe and prosperous AI future. At its core is the **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology**, a proven and iterative approach to managing AI risks and ensuring continuous improvement. To build local capacity, we offer the **CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts International) Certification**, a professional qualification that will empower a new generation of AI safety experts in Kazakhstan. Our unique **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight** provides a novel and robust mechanism for monitoring AI systems and ensuring their alignment with ethical principles. This multi-agent system, inspired by the Byzantine Generals' Problem, is designed to be resilient to single points of failure and to provide a high degree of assurance. By adopting the CSOAI framework, Kazakhstan can rapidly deploy a world-class AI governance system, tailored to its specific needs and priorities. This will not only ensure the safety and well-being of its citizens but also create a stable and predictable environment for businesses to innovate and thrive.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phased approach to implementing the AI Safety Framework in Kazakhstan, designed to deliver rapid results while building a sustainable foundation for long-term success.

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Kazakhstan's existing AI landscape, including its legal and regulatory environment, key industries, and current AI capabilities. Working closely with government stakeholders, we will develop a detailed implementation plan tailored to the country's specific needs and priorities.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework, including the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology and the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight. This will involve configuring the framework to align with Kazakhstan's legal and regulatory requirements and integrating it with existing government systems.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months):** Building local capacity is a cornerstone of our approach. In this phase, we will launch a nationwide training program to certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts through our CEASAI program. This will create a skilled workforce capable of implementing and managing the AI Safety Framework across all sectors of the economy.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** With the framework deployed and a critical mass of certified professionals in place, Kazakhstan will achieve full operational capability. This phase will focus on continuous improvement, ongoing monitoring of AI systems, and further development of the AI safety ecosystem.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, CSOAI is launching a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, and the citizens of Kazakhstan are invited to participate. This is an unprecedented opportunity for individuals to gain a valuable professional qualification and to become part of a global movement to ensure the safe and ethical development of AI. By making this training accessible to all, we aim to create immediate capacity and to empower a diverse new generation of AI safety leaders. This is not just about training; it's about building a global network of expertise and collaboration. We believe that by democratizing access to AI safety education, we can create a safer and more equitable future for all.

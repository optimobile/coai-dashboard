# AI Safety Framework for Mongolia: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

As the world stands on the precipice of a new technological era, the urgency for robust AI governance has never been more apparent. For Mongolia, a nation with a rich history of innovation and a burgeoning digital landscape, the time to act is now. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a comprehensive AI safety framework is not just a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative. The absence of such a framework exposes Mongolia to a myriad of risks, including the potential for algorithmic bias, data privacy breaches, and the erosion of public trust. This can have a chilling effect on innovation and hinder the country's ability to harness the full potential of AI for economic growth and social development. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to this challenge. Our white-label AI Safety Framework, coupled with the CEASAI Certification for local professionals, provides a clear and actionable roadmap for building a safe and ethical AI ecosystem. By embracing a proactive approach to AI governance, Mongolia can not only mitigate the risks associated with this transformative technology but also position itself as a leader in responsible AI adoption, ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared by all its citizens.

## The Current State of AI in Mongolia

Mongolia, a nation at the crossroads of tradition and modernity, is making significant strides in its digital transformation journey. The government's "Digital First" policy has laid a strong foundation for the adoption of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence. A key pillar of this transformation is the **E-Mongolia** platform, a unified portal for digital public services that offers access to over 1,200 services and has reached an impressive 83.9% of the population [1]. This widespread digital adoption, coupled with expanding internet connectivity, has created a fertile ground for the growth of an AI-powered economy.

An AI Landscape Assessment conducted by the UNDP places Mongolia at the **“Systematic” readiness stage** with a score of 3.0 out of 5, indicating that while foundational systems are in place, there is a need for further strengthening to support scalable and responsible AI development [2]. The country's strengths lie in its digital infrastructure, with platforms like E-Mongolia and the KhurDan system providing a solid base for AI integration. However, the assessment also highlights significant challenges, including a limited pool of AI talent, with a shortage of over 27,000 ICT professionals, insufficient high-performance computing capacity, fragmented data systems, and gaps in ethical governance and regulatory frameworks [1].

Despite these challenges, the Mongolian government is proactively working to create a conducive environment for AI innovation. The finalization of a **National AI and Big Data Strategy**, which is set to be discussed in Parliament, is a testament to this commitment [1]. Furthermore, the launch of the **National Initiative for Developing AI Knowledge and Skills (2026–2028)**, a multi-stakeholder initiative in partnership with organizations like the UNDP and Oracle Academy, aims to address the talent gap by training 60,000 public servants, 10,000 workers in vulnerable sectors, and 1,000 student “AI Ambassadors” [2]. On the regulatory front, Mongolia has already put in place personal data protection and cybersecurity laws, which provide a starting point for a more comprehensive AI governance framework [2].

While AI adoption is still in its early stages, several key sectors are poised to benefit from this technology. The vast and sparsely populated landscape of Mongolia presents unique opportunities for AI applications in **agriculture and livestock management**, where AI-powered solutions can help optimize pasture rotation and monitor animal health. The country's vulnerability to climate change also makes it a prime candidate for the use of AI in **climate resilience**, with predictive modeling for droughts and other extreme weather events. Furthermore, the government's vision of fostering a "digital nomad" strategy opens up possibilities for the growth of an AI-driven **talent economy**, attracting and retaining skilled professionals in the field [1]. As Mongolia continues on its path of digital transformation, the strategic implementation of AI will be crucial in unlocking new avenues for economic growth and social progress.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its commendable progress in digital transformation, Mongolia finds itself among 118 countries that are yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This gap represents a significant vulnerability in an increasingly AI-driven world. Without a clear set of rules and regulations to guide the development and deployment of AI, Mongolia risks falling behind in the global digital economy and exposing its citizens and businesses to a range of potential harms. The absence of a national AI strategy and governance framework creates a vacuum that can be filled by a patchwork of ad-hoc policies and standards, leading to a fragmented and inconsistent approach to AI governance.

The risks of not having a comprehensive AI governance framework are manifold. From an economic perspective, the lack of a clear regulatory environment can deter foreign investment and make it difficult for Mongolian businesses to compete on the international stage. Investors are more likely to put their capital into markets with predictable and transparent rules, and the absence of such a framework in Mongolia could be a significant red flag. Furthermore, without a national AI strategy, the country may miss out on the opportunity to strategically invest in AI research and development, further widening the gap with more advanced economies.

On a societal level, the unregulated use of AI can lead to a host of problems. Algorithmic bias, for instance, can perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities, leading to discrimination in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice. The proliferation of AI-powered surveillance technologies also raises serious concerns about data privacy and the potential for mass surveillance. Moreover, the displacement of jobs due to automation is a major concern for workers and a potential source of social unrest. Without a just transition plan in place, the benefits of AI could be concentrated in the hands of a few, while the costs are borne by the many.

The impact of this governance gap is felt by both citizens and businesses. For citizens, it means a lack of protection from AI-related harms and limited recourse when things go wrong. For businesses, it creates a climate of uncertainty that stifles innovation and makes it difficult to plan for the long term. The absence of a clear legal and regulatory framework also exposes businesses to reputational risks, as they may be held liable for the unintended consequences of their AI systems. In short, the AI governance gap is a major obstacle to Mongolia's aspirations of becoming a leader in the digital age. It is a challenge that must be addressed with urgency and a clear sense of purpose.

## CSOAI's Solution for Mongolia

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) provides a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Mongolia's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework is designed to be adapted to the specific needs and cultural context of Mongolia, providing a ready-made yet flexible foundation for building a robust and ethical AI ecosystem. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a set of best practices, guidelines, and standards that can be tailored to align with Mongolia's national priorities and development goals. It covers the entire AI lifecycle, from data acquisition and model development to deployment and ongoing monitoring, ensuring that AI systems are safe, fair, and transparent.

At the heart of our solution is the **CEASAI Certification**, a professional certification program designed to build a local pool of AI safety experts. This program will equip Mongolian professionals with the skills and knowledge they need to design, develop, and deploy AI systems that are aligned with ethical principles and international standards. By creating a pipeline of certified AI safety analysts, Mongolia can reduce its reliance on foreign expertise and build a self-sustaining AI ecosystem. The CEASAI certification program is a key component of our commitment to capacity building and knowledge transfer, empowering Mongolians to take ownership of their AI future.

To ensure the ongoing safety and reliability of AI systems, our framework includes a novel governance model known as the **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight**. This decentralized and distributed governance structure is inspired by the principles of Byzantine fault tolerance, a concept from computer science that ensures the reliability of a system even when some of its components fail. The 33-Agent Council is composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government representatives, industry experts, academics, and civil society organizations. This multi-stakeholder approach ensures that a wide range of perspectives are taken into account in the governance of AI, promoting transparency, accountability, and public trust.

Finally, our solution includes the **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology**, a continuous improvement framework that helps organizations to systematically manage their AI risks and opportunities. Based on the well-established Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, this methodology provides a structured approach to AI governance, enabling organizations to identify, assess, and mitigate AI-related risks on an ongoing basis. The SOAI-PDCA methodology is a practical and effective tool for implementing the principles of our AI Safety Framework, helping organizations to build a culture of responsible AI innovation. Together, these four components of our solution provide a comprehensive and holistic approach to AI governance, enabling Mongolia to navigate the complexities of the AI revolution with confidence and a clear sense of direction.

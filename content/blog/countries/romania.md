# AI Safety Framework for Romania: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act set to be fully applicable by February 2, 2026, the clock is ticking for Romania to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence presents both immense opportunities and significant risks. Without a robust governance structure, Romania faces challenges in ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI, potentially hindering its digital transformation and economic growth. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this gap, providing a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a proven compliance methodology. This is a critical moment for Romania to act decisively, secure its digital future, and position itself as a leader in responsible AI adoption within the EU.

## Current State of AI in Romania

Romania is at a pivotal point in its digital journey, with AI adoption steadily increasing. The country's vibrant tech ecosystem, coupled with a strong pool of IT talent, has laid the groundwork for AI integration across various sectors. Key industries leading the charge include IT and software development, where AI is used for process automation and to enhance software capabilities. The financial services sector is leveraging AI for fraud detection and personalized customer experiences, while the manufacturing and automotive industries are exploring AI-powered solutions for robotics and supply chain optimization. The Romanian government has recognized the transformative potential of AI and has taken initial steps to foster its adoption. The approval of the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for 2024-2027 in July 2024 signals a clear commitment to harnessing AI for economic and social progress. This strategy aims to accelerate AI adoption, develop digital skills, and create a favorable environment for AI innovation. However, challenges remain. According to a 2025 Eurostat report, Romania still lags behind other EU countries in AI usage among enterprises. Furthermore, the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) highlights the need to improve digital public services and bridge the digital skills gap. Despite these hurdles, the combination of government support, a thriving tech scene, and a growing awareness of AI's benefits positions Romania to make significant strides in the AI landscape.

## The AI Governance Gap

Romania is one of 118 countries worldwide that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This regulatory gap poses significant risks to the nation's digital future, its citizens, and its businesses. Without clear guidelines and oversight, the development and deployment of AI systems can lead to unintended consequences, such as algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and a lack of accountability. For citizens, the absence of a framework means their fundamental rights may not be adequately protected in an increasingly AI-driven world. Businesses, on the other hand, face legal uncertainty and a lack of a level playing field, which can stifle innovation and investment. The EU AI Act will soon impose strict requirements on high-risk AI systems, and Romanian companies that are not prepared will face significant compliance challenges and potential penalties. The lack of a national AI governance framework also puts Romania at a competitive disadvantage, as other countries are moving quickly to establish themselves as leaders in responsible AI. To build trust in AI and unlock its full potential, it is imperative for Romania to close this governance gap and establish a clear and comprehensive framework for the safe and ethical use of artificial intelligence.

## CSOAI's Solution for Romania

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to help Romania navigate the complexities of AI governance and accelerate its compliance with the EU AI Act. Our solution is built on four key pillars:

*   **White-label AI Safety Framework:** A customizable and ready-to-deploy framework that provides the necessary policies, standards, and guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment. This framework is aligned with international best practices and can be adapted to Romania's specific needs and regulatory context.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** The Council of European AI Safety Analysts (CEASAI) offers a professional certification program to train and accredit local AI safety experts. This program will create a pool of qualified professionals in Romania who can help organizations implement and manage their AI safety frameworks, ensuring long-term sustainability and capacity building.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** A decentralized and resilient governance model for AI oversight, inspired by the Byzantine Generals' Problem. This council of 33 specialized AI agents provides a robust and tamper-proof mechanism for monitoring and auditing AI systems, ensuring their safety, fairness, and transparency.
*   **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A proven and structured approach to AI compliance, based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. This methodology helps organizations systematically identify, assess, and mitigate AI risks, ensuring continuous improvement and adherence to regulatory requirements.

By adopting CSOAI's solution, Romania can rapidly establish a world-class AI governance framework, build local expertise, and foster a culture of responsible AI innovation. This will not only ensure compliance with the EU AI Act but also position Romania as a trusted leader in the global AI landscape.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phased approach to implement the AI Safety Framework in Romania, ensuring a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance.

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Romania's current AI landscape, including its legal and regulatory framework, key stakeholders, and existing AI initiatives. Based on this assessment, we will develop a detailed implementation plan tailored to Romania's specific needs and priorities.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will work closely with the Romanian government and other stakeholders to deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework. This will include customizing the framework, establishing the necessary governance structures, and launching a public awareness campaign to promote responsible AI.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months):** Through our CEASAI certification program, we will train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Romania. These professionals will become the backbone of Romania's AI governance ecosystem, providing the expertise needed to implement and manage AI safety frameworks across the public and private sectors.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** Once the framework is deployed and the first cohort of AI Safety Analysts is trained, Romania will have achieved full operational capability in AI governance. This phase will focus on continuous improvement, ongoing monitoring of AI systems, and further development of the AI ecosystem.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, CSOAI is offering a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative provides free access to our CEASAI certification program for 500,250 aspiring AI Safety Analysts worldwide, including in Romania. This is a unique opportunity for Romanian citizens to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the AI-driven economy. By participating in this program, they will not only enhance their career prospects but also contribute to the safe and ethical development of AI in their country. The CEASAI certification is a globally recognized credential that will open doors to new opportunities in the rapidly growing field of AI safety and governance.

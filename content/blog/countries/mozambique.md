# AI Safety Framework for Mozambique: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Mozambique stands at a critical juncture where the decisions made today regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI) will shape its economic and social landscape for decades to come. With the European Union's AI Act set to be fully applicable by August 2, 2026, the urgency for Mozambique to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. This framework is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to unlock AI's immense potential while mitigating its inherent risks. For a nation with a burgeoning digital ecosystem and a youthful population, a proactive approach to AI governance will be the cornerstone of sustainable and inclusive development. The CSOAI's proposed white-label AI Safety Framework, coupled with the CEASAI Certification and the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, offers a turnkey solution for Mozambique to leapfrog into the era of safe and ethical AI. This is a moment of decision for Mozambique – a chance to build a future where AI serves as a catalyst for progress, not a source of inequality or harm.

## Current State of AI in Mozambique

Mozambique is at a pivotal moment in its technological journey. While the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is still in its nascent stages, the country is demonstrating a growing awareness of AI's transformative potential. The government, in partnership with international organizations like UNESCO, has begun to lay the groundwork for a national AI strategy, signaling a commitment to harnessing this technology for economic and social development. This proactive stance is crucial as Mozambique navigates the complexities of the digital age and seeks to create a more prosperous and resilient future for its citizens.

The current landscape of AI in Mozambique is characterized by a mix of early-stage applications and ambitious government-led initiatives. AI is already making inroads in various sectors, including agriculture, where it is being used to improve crop yields and manage resources more effectively. In the financial sector, AI-powered tools are being deployed to enhance tax compliance and modernize the VAT system. Furthermore, the government is exploring the use of AI to bolster its early warning systems for natural disasters, a critical step in a country prone to climate-related events. These initial forays into AI are promising, but they also highlight the need for a more coordinated and strategic approach to AI development and deployment.

Several key industries in Mozambique are ripe for AI-driven transformation. Agriculture, the backbone of the nation's economy, stands to benefit significantly from AI applications in areas such as precision farming, pest control, and supply chain optimization. The energy sector, particularly the burgeoning natural gas industry, can leverage AI for exploration, production, and maintenance, while the logistics and transportation sectors can use AI to improve efficiency and reduce costs. In healthcare, AI has the potential to revolutionize service delivery, from diagnostics and treatment to public health management. However, realizing this potential will require substantial investment in infrastructure, human capital, and a supportive regulatory environment.

The Mozambican government has embarked on a digital transformation agenda, recognizing that technology is a key enabler of inclusive growth. Initiatives to expand internet access, promote digital literacy, and create a more favorable environment for tech startups are underway. While specific technology regulations are still evolving, the government's collaboration with UNESCO on a national AI strategy indicates a commitment to developing a framework that is both innovative and ethical. This framework will be essential for guiding the responsible development and deployment of AI, ensuring that it aligns with the country's development goals and respects the rights and privacy of its citizens.

## The AI Governance Gap

Mozambique is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap is not unique to Mozambique; many nations are grappling with the rapid pace of AI development and the complex challenges it presents. However, the absence of a clear regulatory landscape creates a vacuum where the risks of AI can proliferate unchecked. Without a framework to guide the development and deployment of AI, Mozambique is vulnerable to a range of negative consequences, from the perpetuation of biases in algorithmic decision-making to the erosion of privacy and the potential for job displacement. This governance gap is a critical issue that must be addressed to ensure that AI is a force for good in Mozambique.

The risks of not having an AI governance framework are manifold. For citizens, it can mean a lack of protection against the misuse of their personal data, the potential for discrimination in areas such as loan applications and hiring, and a general lack of transparency and accountability in how AI systems are used. For businesses, the absence of clear rules can create uncertainty and stifle innovation, as companies may be hesitant to invest in AI without a clear understanding of their legal and ethical obligations. Furthermore, the lack of a national AI strategy can put Mozambican businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace, as they may struggle to keep pace with their counterparts in countries with more advanced AI ecosystems.

The impact of the AI governance gap extends beyond individual citizens and businesses to the very fabric of society. The unregulated use of AI can exacerbate existing inequalities, create new forms of social division, and undermine trust in public institutions. It can also leave the country vulnerable to external threats, such as the manipulation of information and the use of AI for malicious purposes. In a world where AI is increasingly shaping our lives, the absence of a robust governance framework is not just a missed opportunity; it is a significant threat to Mozambique's future prosperity and stability.

## CSOAI's Solution for Mozambique

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to address the specific challenges and opportunities facing Mozambique. This is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a customizable framework that can be adapted to the country's unique legal, cultural, and economic context. The CSOAI's approach is built on the principle of empowering local stakeholders, providing them with the tools, training, and support they need to build a robust and sustainable AI governance ecosystem. Our solution is designed to be implemented quickly and efficiently, enabling Mozambique to bridge the AI governance gap and position itself as a leader in responsible AI in the region.

At the heart of the CSOAI's solution is the CEASAI Certification program, which is designed to create a new generation of AI safety professionals in Mozambique. This program provides comprehensive training in all aspects of AI governance, from technical standards and risk management to ethical considerations and legal compliance. By certifying local professionals, we are not just building capacity; we are creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of expertise that will be essential for the long-term success of Mozambique's AI strategy. The CEASAI certification is a globally recognized credential that will open up new opportunities for Mozambican professionals and help to attract investment in the country's tech sector.

To ensure the highest level of oversight and accountability, the CSOAI's framework includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This innovative governance structure is composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry representatives, academics, and civil society organizations. The council's role is to provide independent oversight of the AI ecosystem, ensuring that all AI systems are developed and deployed in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner. The Byzantine fault tolerance model ensures that the council can continue to function effectively even in the face of disagreements or disruptions, providing a resilient and trustworthy mechanism for AI governance.

Compliance with the CSOAI's framework is facilitated by the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology, a proven and internationally recognized approach to continuous improvement. This methodology provides a structured and systematic way for organizations to manage their AI risks and ensure that they are in compliance with the relevant regulations and standards. The SOAI-PDCA methodology is not just a set of rules; it is a dynamic and iterative process that enables organizations to learn from their experiences and continuously improve their AI governance practices. By adopting this methodology, Mozambican organizations can build a culture of responsibility and accountability that will be essential for the long-term success of their AI initiatives.

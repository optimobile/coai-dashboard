# AI Safety Framework for Cambodia: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Cambodia to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. The nation stands at a critical juncture, with the potential to leapfrog into a future of safe and ethical AI-driven growth or risk falling behind in a rapidly evolving global digital landscape. The absence of a robust governance structure exposes Cambodia to significant risks, including biased algorithms, data privacy breaches, and a lack of accountability, which could undermine citizen trust and hinder business innovation. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution: a white-label AI Safety Framework, complete with local professional certification (CEASAI), a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. This is a pivotal moment for Cambodia to not just participate in the AI revolution but to lead with foresight and integrity, ensuring that technological advancement aligns with the nation's values and the well-being of its people.

## Current State of AI in Cambodia

Cambodia's journey into the age of artificial intelligence is in its nascent stages, characterized by a cautious yet optimistic embrace of AI's potential. While widespread adoption is not yet the norm, key sectors are beginning to explore and integrate AI technologies. The financial industry, for instance, is experimenting with AI for credit scoring and risk management, while the burgeoning e-commerce sector leverages AI for personalized recommendations and logistics optimization. In agriculture, a cornerstone of the Cambodian economy, there is growing interest in using AI for crop monitoring and yield prediction to enhance food security.

The Royal Government of Cambodia has demonstrated a clear commitment to digital transformation through its "Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework 2021–2035". This strategic document outlines a roadmap for building a vibrant digital economy, with a focus on developing digital government, promoting digital business, and fostering digital citizenship. While the framework does not yet contain specific, detailed regulations for AI, it lays the groundwork for a future where technology is a key driver of national development. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications is actively working on a National AI Strategy, which is expected to provide a more comprehensive governance structure for AI development and deployment in the kingdom. Existing regulations, such as the draft Law on Personal Data Protection, are also being reviewed to ensure they are fit for the AI era. These initiatives, coupled with a growing number of AI-powered startups, signal a promising future for AI in Cambodia, but also highlight the urgent need for a robust governance framework to guide this transformation.

## The AI Governance Gap

Cambodia is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal, comprehensive AI governance framework. This "governance gap" presents a significant challenge to the nation's aspirations for a safe and prosperous digital future. Without clear rules of the road, the development and deployment of AI systems can become a "wild west," where the potential for harm is as great as the potential for good. The risks are manifold: biased algorithms could perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities; the misuse of personal data could lead to widespread privacy violations; and the lack of transparency and accountability in AI decision-making could erode public trust in both technology and government.

For Cambodian citizens, the absence of AI governance means they are left vulnerable to the whims of unregulated AI systems, with little recourse if they are harmed by an AI-driven decision. For businesses, the lack of a clear legal and ethical framework creates uncertainty, stifling innovation and making it difficult to compete in a global market where trust and safety are increasingly important. The AI governance gap is not just a theoretical problem; it is a real and present danger to Cambodia's economic and social well-being. Addressing this gap is not a matter of choice, but a matter of necessity.

## CSOAI's Solution for Cambodia

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to address Cambodia's specific needs and challenges. This is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a flexible and adaptable framework that can be tailored to the Cambodian context. At the heart of the CSOAI solution is the **CEASAI Certification**, a professional qualification for local AI safety analysts. This program will create a new generation of Cambodian experts who are equipped with the skills and knowledge to design, build, and manage safe and ethical AI systems.

To ensure robust oversight, the CSOAI proposes the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council**, an independent body of experts from government, industry, academia, and civil society. This council will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the AI Safety Framework, providing guidance on emerging ethical and safety issues, and ensuring that AI is developed and used in a way that benefits all Cambodians. The **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** provides a practical, step-by-step approach to implementing the AI Safety Framework. This iterative process allows for continuous improvement and ensures that the framework remains relevant and effective in the face of rapid technological change.

## Implementation Roadmap

The implementation of the CSOAI AI Safety Framework in Cambodia will be a multi-phase process, designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance.

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Cambodia's existing AI landscape, including a review of current policies, regulations, and infrastructure. This will be followed by the development of a detailed implementation plan, tailored to Cambodia's specific needs and priorities.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, the CSOAI AI Safety Framework will be deployed across government and key industries. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the rollout of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** This phase will focus on building local capacity through the training and certification of 1,000 Cambodian AI safety analysts. This will be achieved through the CEASAI certification program, which will be delivered in partnership with local universities and training institutions.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In the final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with a critical mass of trained professionals, a robust governance structure, and a culture of safe and ethical AI development and use.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of its commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, the CSOAI is offering a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including a significant number of places for Cambodian citizens. This is a unique opportunity for Cambodia to rapidly build its domestic AI safety capacity, creating a new generation of skilled professionals who can lead the country's AI revolution. The giveaway is not just about providing free training; it is about empowering individuals and communities to shape their own AI future.

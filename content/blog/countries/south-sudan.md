# AI Safety Framework for South Sudan: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

South Sudan stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) present a unique opportunity for national development, but also significant risks if left unmanaged. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for South Sudan to establish a robust AI safety framework is now. The absence of such a framework exposes the nation to a range of threats, including data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and economic disruption. A proactive approach to AI governance will not only mitigate these risks but also position South Sudan to harness the full potential of AI for economic growth and social progress. This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for implementing a national AI safety framework, tailored to the specific needs and context of South Sudan.

## The Current State of AI in South Sudan

Artificial Intelligence in South Sudan is at a nascent stage, characterized by pockets of adoption in urban centers amidst a landscape of significant digital divides. The use of AI is most visible in the education sector, where students in cities like Juba are leveraging AI-powered applications such as Photomath and ChatGPT to supplement their learning. These tools offer valuable support, particularly in a country grappling with a shortage of qualified teachers. However, this burgeoning adoption is accompanied by concerns from educators about the potential for over-reliance on AI, which could hinder the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students.

The primary barrier to wider AI adoption is the stark digital divide between urban and rural areas. With internet penetration at just 15.7% as of early 2025, the benefits of AI remain inaccessible to a large portion of the population. This disparity threatens to exacerbate existing inequalities, creating a society of digital haves and have-nots. Furthermore, the lack of a robust data protection framework raises significant concerns about data privacy and security, making citizens vulnerable to the misuse of their personal information.

In response to these challenges, the South Sudanese government has embarked on an ambitious digital transformation agenda. A presidential decree has mandated the full digitization of all public institutions by January 2025, with the Electronic Services Council granted full authority to spearhead this initiative. Early results are promising, with the introduction of e-services reportedly contributing to a 40% improvement in the national economy. These efforts, however, are hampered by South Sudan's low ranking in the UN E-Government Development Index and the World Bank's assessment of the country's digital economy as being in its very early stages. The lack of a clear regulatory framework for the ICT sector, coupled with a fragile macroeconomic environment and security challenges, continues to deter private investment and hinder progress.

On the regulatory front, South Sudan is beginning to take steps to address the legal vacuum surrounding technology. While a comprehensive data protection law is not yet in place, the government has announced its intention to introduce a Data Protection Bill in 2026. This bill is intended to complement the recently passed Cybercrime and Computer Misuse Bill of 2025. However, civil society organizations have voiced concerns about the new cybercrime legislation, pointing to a lack of technical capacity among law enforcement agencies to investigate online crimes and the potential for the law to be misused. These challenges underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive and well-thought-out AI governance framework that can guide the country's digital future.

## The AI Governance Gap

South Sudan is one of 118 countries worldwide that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This gap places the nation in a precarious position, unable to fully capitalize on the opportunities of the AI revolution while being exposed to its inherent risks. The absence of a strategic approach to AI governance creates a vacuum where technology adoption can be haphazard, inequitable, and potentially harmful.

The risks associated with this governance gap are multifaceted. Economically, South Sudan risks being left behind, becoming a passive consumer of AI technologies developed elsewhere rather than a creator of its own solutions. This could lead to a new form of digital colonialism, widening the development gap between South Sudan and more technologically advanced nations. Without a clear regulatory environment, both local and foreign investment in the country's nascent tech sector is likely to be stifled, hindering innovation and job creation.

For citizens, the lack of AI governance poses significant threats to their fundamental rights and well-being. The collection and use of personal data without adequate safeguards can lead to widespread privacy violations. Algorithmic bias, embedded in AI systems trained on incomplete or skewed data, can perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas such as loan applications, hiring, and even criminal justice. Furthermore, the unregulated use of AI could lead to job displacement in key sectors and presents a risk of misuse for political manipulation or surveillance, eroding public trust and social cohesion.

Businesses in South Sudan also face considerable challenges due to the absence of a clear AI framework. The legal and regulatory uncertainty makes it difficult for companies to innovate and adopt AI technologies with confidence. Local startups and SMEs, in particular, may find it impossible to compete with large multinational corporations that have the resources to navigate this ambiguous landscape. Moreover, without a data protection framework that meets international standards, South Sudanese businesses will face significant barriers to accessing global markets, particularly the European Union, with its strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the upcoming AI Act.

## CSOAI's Solution for South Sudan

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address South Sudan's AI governance gap. Our approach is designed to be rapidly deployable, cost-effective, and tailored to the unique needs of developing nations. We provide a four-pronged solution that empowers South Sudan to build a robust and resilient AI ecosystem.

**1. White-label AI Safety Framework:**

CSOAI provides a ready-to-implement, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be adapted to South Sudan's specific legal and cultural context. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and comprehensive set of guidelines, best practices, and regulatory templates. It covers the entire AI lifecycle, from data acquisition and model development to deployment and ongoing monitoring. The framework is designed to be aligned with international standards, including the EU AI Act and the OECD AI Principles, ensuring that South Sudan's AI governance is globally recognized and respected. This will not only foster trust among citizens and investors but also facilitate international trade and collaboration.

**2. CEASAI Certification for Local Professionals:**

To build local capacity and create a sustainable AI ecosystem, CSOAI offers the Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation (CEASAI) program. This certification is designed to equip South Sudanese professionals with the skills and knowledge needed to design, implement, and audit AI systems in a safe and ethical manner. The CEASAI curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including AI ethics, risk management, data governance, and regulatory compliance.

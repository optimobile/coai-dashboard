# AI Safety Framework for Ukraine: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Ukraine to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. Ukraine, a nation that has demonstrated remarkable resilience and digital innovation, stands at a critical juncture. The rapid adoption of AI technologies, particularly in defense and public services, has created a governance gap that, if left unaddressed, could expose the nation to significant risks. This article outlines a strategic roadmap for Ukraine to not only meet the EU AI Act requirements but also to position itself as a global leader in AI governance. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution: a white-label AI Safety Framework, the CEASAI Certification for local professionals, a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. This proactive approach will empower Ukraine to build a robust and resilient AI ecosystem that fosters innovation, protects its citizens, and secures its digital future.

## Current State of AI in Ukraine

Ukraine has made remarkable strides in the field of artificial intelligence, demonstrating a strong commitment to digital transformation even amidst the challenges of war. The nation has climbed 14 places in the Government AI Readiness Index 2025, moving from 54th to 40th place among 195 countries [1]. This significant leap is a testament to the country's resilient and forward-thinking approach to technology.

Key industries in Ukraine are increasingly adopting AI to enhance efficiency and innovation. The defense sector, in particular, has become a hotbed for AI-driven solutions, with the development and deployment of autonomous drones and AI-powered intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems [2]. These technologies have been instrumental in the country's defense efforts, showcasing the transformative power of AI in modern warfare. Beyond defense, the public sector is also embracing AI to improve public services. The launch of Diia.AI, the world's first national AI assistant for public services, is a clear indication of Ukraine's ambition to become a global leader in GovTech [1].

The Ukrainian government has been proactive in its digital transformation initiatives. The Ministry of Digital Transformation has set an ambitious goal for Ukraine to become one of the top three countries in the world for AI implementation by 2030 [1]. To achieve this, the government has launched several key initiatives, including the development of a national AI strategy and the creation of the AI Factory, an initiative aimed at building sovereign AI infrastructure [1]. While Ukraine has a roadmap for AI regulation, there is still a need for a comprehensive legal framework to govern the development and deployment of AI technologies [3]. The existing technology regulations are still evolving, and the country is working towards harmonizing its legislation with the EU AI Act.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its impressive progress in AI adoption and innovation, Ukraine is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This governance gap poses significant risks to the nation, its citizens, and its businesses. Without a robust regulatory framework, there is a heightened risk of an uncoordinated approach to AI development and deployment, which could lead to the proliferation of unsafe and unethical AI systems. The absence of clear guidelines and standards can also stifle innovation, as businesses may be hesitant to invest in AI without legal certainty.

The lack of a national AI governance framework also has serious implications for Ukraine's citizens. It could lead to the erosion of fundamental rights, such as privacy and data protection, as well as the potential for algorithmic bias and discrimination. For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory landscape creates uncertainty and can hinder their ability to compete in the global market. As Ukraine continues to integrate with the European Union, the need to align with the EU's AI Act becomes increasingly critical. Failure to do so could result in barriers to trade and a loss of access to the EU's digital single market.

## CSOAI's Solution for Ukraine

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to address Ukraine's specific needs and challenges. This turnkey solution provides a clear and actionable roadmap for establishing a robust AI governance ecosystem that is fully compliant with the EU AI Act. The framework is built on four key pillars:

1.  **White-label AI Safety Framework:** CSOAI provides a customizable framework that can be adapted to Ukraine's unique legal and cultural context. This framework includes a set of principles, guidelines, and best practices for the responsible development and deployment of AI.

2.  **CEASAI Certification:** The Council of European AI Safety Analysts (CEASAI) offers a world-class certification program for local professionals. This program will equip Ukrainian experts with the skills and knowledge needed to become certified AI Safety Analysts, creating a new generation of leaders in AI governance.

3.  **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** To ensure robust oversight and accountability, CSOAI proposes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This decentralized and resilient governance body will be responsible for monitoring the AI ecosystem, identifying potential risks, and making recommendations for regulatory action.

4.  **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** The SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI compliance. This methodology will enable Ukrainian organizations to continuously monitor and improve their AI systems, ensuring that they remain safe, ethical, and compliant with evolving regulations.

By implementing CSOAI's solution, Ukraine can not only close its AI governance gap but also position itself as a global leader in AI safety and ethics. This proactive approach will enable the country to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating the associated risks.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a four-phase implementation roadmap to guide Ukraine on its journey to full AI governance:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Ukraine's current AI landscape, including its legal and regulatory framework, key stakeholders, and existing AI initiatives. Based on this assessment, a detailed implementation plan will be developed in close collaboration with the Ukrainian government and other key stakeholders.

*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, the white-label AI Safety Framework will be customized and deployed across Ukraine. This will involve the development of new laws and regulations, as well as the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI.

*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months):** Through the CEASAI certification program, this phase will focus on training a new generation of AI Safety Analysts in Ukraine. These analysts will play a critical role in implementing and enforcing the new AI governance framework.

*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** Once the framework is in place and the first cohort of AI Safety Analysts has been trained, Ukraine will have achieved full operational capability in AI governance. This will be an ongoing process of continuous improvement, with the SOAI-PDCA methodology being used to monitor and refine the AI ecosystem.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

To kickstart the development of a robust AI safety ecosystem in Ukraine, CSOAI is proud to announce a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 aspiring AI Safety Analysts globally, with a significant portion allocated to Ukrainian citizens. This unprecedented program will create immediate capacity in AI governance and empower a new generation of experts to lead the way in building a safe and ethical AI future. By providing free access to world-class training, CSOAI is committed to democratizing AI safety and ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to participate in this critical field.

# AI Safety Framework for Vietnam: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Vietnam is at a critical juncture. As a leader in AI adoption and innovation in Southeast Asia, the nation has a unique opportunity to establish a robust AI governance framework before the European Union's AI Act deadline in February 2026. The rapid proliferation of AI technologies brings immense economic potential but also significant risks if left unregulated. A proactive approach to AI safety is not just a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to build trust, attract investment, and ensure that AI development aligns with Vietnam's societal values and economic goals. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label solution to help Vietnam navigate this complex landscape, providing the tools, training, and expertise needed to build a secure and prosperous AI-powered future.

## Current State of AI in Vietnam

Vietnam has emerged as a dynamic and rapidly growing hub for Artificial Intelligence in Southeast Asia. The country's AI market is projected to reach $2.81 billion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.96% [1]. This growth is fueled by a combination of strong government support, a burgeoning startup ecosystem, and high rates of AI adoption across key industries. The Vietnamese government has demonstrated a clear commitment to digital transformation, enacting progressive legislation like the Law on Artificial Intelligence (2025) and the Digital Technology Industry Law (2025) to foster innovation while establishing a legal framework for AI development and deployment [2].

Key industries leveraging AI in Vietnam include manufacturing, finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In the manufacturing sector, AI-powered robotics and process automation are enhancing efficiency and productivity. The financial services industry is utilizing AI for fraud detection, credit scoring, and personalized banking experiences. In healthcare, AI is being applied to medical diagnostics and treatment personalization, with companies like VinBrain making significant strides in this area [3]. The e-commerce sector, with major players like Tiki and Shopee, relies heavily on AI for recommendation engines, logistics optimization, and customer service.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its impressive progress in AI adoption and innovation, Vietnam is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This governance gap poses significant risks to both citizens and businesses. Without clear regulations and oversight, there is a greater potential for biased algorithms, privacy violations, and the misuse of AI for malicious purposes. For citizens, this could mean facing discrimination in areas like loan applications or job recruitment, or having their personal data exploited without their consent. For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory framework creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and can lead to a loss of public trust. Furthermore, as international regulations like the EU AI Act come into effect, Vietnamese companies that do not adhere to global standards may face barriers to accessing international markets.

## CSOAI's Solution for Vietnam

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to address Vietnam's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework is a comprehensive, customizable platform that can be adapted to Vietnam's specific needs and regulatory context. The framework is built on our proprietary SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, a continuous improvement model that ensures ongoing adherence to the highest standards of AI safety and ethics.

At the core of our solution is the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, a decentralized AI oversight mechanism that provides robust and resilient governance. This innovative approach to AI safety ensures that no single point of failure can compromise the integrity of the system. To build local capacity, we offer the CEASAI Certification, a globally recognized program that will train and certify a new generation of AI Safety Analysts in Vietnam. This program will not only create a skilled workforce but also foster a culture of AI safety and responsibility within the country.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phase implementation roadmap to deploy the AI Safety Framework in Vietnam:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** In this initial phase, we will work closely with Vietnamese government agencies and industry stakeholders to conduct a thorough assessment of the country's existing AI landscape and regulatory environment. This will enable us to tailor the AI Safety Framework to Vietnam's specific needs and priorities.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** Following the assessment and planning phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework, integrating it with existing government systems and infrastructure. This will include the setup of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the implementation of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** To ensure the long-term sustainability of the framework, we will launch a nationwide training program to certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts through our CEASAI program. This will create a skilled workforce capable of overseeing and managing the AI safety ecosystem in Vietnam.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In the final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, providing ongoing monitoring, oversight, and support to ensure the safe and ethical development and deployment of AI in Vietnam.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, CSOAI is launching a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including a significant number of citizens in Vietnam. This program will create immediate capacity for AI safety and governance in Vietnam, empowering individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the AI-powered economy of the future.

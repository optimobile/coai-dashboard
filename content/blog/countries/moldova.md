# AI Safety Framework for Moldova: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Moldova stands at a critical juncture. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the nation must act decisively to establish a robust AI safety framework. The absence of a national strategy for AI governance exposes Moldova to significant risks, including the unchecked proliferation of biased algorithms, the erosion of privacy, and a decline in public trust. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for fostering innovation, attracting investment, and ensuring that the development and deployment of artificial intelligence align with Moldova's national interests and the well-being of its citizens. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label solution designed to bridge this governance gap, providing Moldova with the tools, training, and expertise to build a secure and prosperous digital future.

## Current State of AI in Moldova

Recent years have witnessed a notable surge in AI adoption across Moldova, a trend reflective of the nation's broader digital transformation. The ICT sector, a significant contributor to the national GDP, has been at the forefront of this movement, with a growing number of companies leveraging AI to enhance their products and services. While Moldova may not yet be a global AI powerhouse, a vibrant ecosystem of startups and established IT firms is emerging, eager to harness the potential of artificial intelligence. Key industries embracing AI include software development, where it is used to automate coding and testing processes, and the burgeoning call center industry, which is exploring AI-powered solutions for customer service and support. The agricultural sector, a cornerstone of the Moldovan economy, is also beginning to experiment with AI-driven precision farming techniques to optimize crop yields and resource management.

The Moldovan government has demonstrated a clear commitment to digital transformation through its 'Digital Transformation Strategy 2023-2030'. This ambitious roadmap outlines a comprehensive vision for modernizing public services, fostering a digital economy, and enhancing digital skills among the population. While the strategy does not yet include a specific national framework for AI governance, it provides a solid foundation upon which such a framework can be built. Existing technology regulations, such as the Law on Electronic Communications and data protection laws, offer a starting point for addressing the legal and ethical challenges posed by AI. However, these regulations are not sufficient to address the unique complexities of AI, highlighting the urgent need for a dedicated AI safety framework.

## The AI Governance Gap

Moldova is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive national strategy for AI governance. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks, from the perpetuation of algorithmic bias to the misuse of personal data. Without a clear framework for the ethical development and deployment of AI, citizens are at risk of being subjected to discriminatory or unfair treatment by automated systems, while businesses face legal uncertainty and a lack of clear guidelines for innovation. The absence of a national AI strategy also hinders Moldova's ability to compete in the global digital economy, as international partners and investors increasingly prioritize countries with robust and predictable regulatory environments. The potential impact on both citizens and businesses is significant, underscoring the urgent need for Moldova to bridge this governance gap and establish a clear and comprehensive AI safety framework.

## CSOAI's Solution for Moldova

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to address Moldova's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a comprehensive set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be readily adapted to Moldova's specific needs and legal context. This framework is designed to be fully compliant with the EU AI Act, ensuring that Moldova can seamlessly integrate with the European digital single market.

At the heart of our solution is the Certified Expert in AI Safety (CEASAI) program, a rigorous training and certification course for local professionals. By equipping Moldovan experts with the skills and knowledge to serve as AI Safety Analysts, we empower the nation to build its own capacity for AI governance and oversight. These certified professionals will play a crucial role in implementing and managing the AI safety framework, ensuring that it is applied effectively across all sectors of the economy.

To further enhance AI oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council, a decentralized and resilient governance body composed of diverse stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society. This council will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the AI safety framework, resolving disputes, and providing guidance on emerging AI-related issues. The Byzantine fault-tolerant design of the council ensures its robustness and prevents any single point of failure.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI governance. This methodology enables organizations to continuously assess their AI systems, identify and mitigate risks, and improve their AI safety practices over time. By adopting this proactive and adaptive approach to compliance, Moldova can ensure that its AI ecosystem remains safe, ethical, and aligned with international best practices.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Moldova, ensuring a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Moldova's existing legal and regulatory landscape, as well as a detailed analysis of the country's AI ecosystem. Working in close collaboration with government stakeholders, we will develop a tailored implementation plan that aligns with Moldova's national priorities and the requirements of the EU AI Act.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In this phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework, adapting it to Moldova's specific legal and cultural context. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the development of detailed guidelines for the ethical and responsible use of AI.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

Through our CEASAI certification program, we will train and certify 1,000 Moldovan professionals as AI Safety Analysts. This will create a sustainable, in-country capacity for AI governance and oversight, reducing reliance on foreign expertise and fostering a local community of practice.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

Upon completion of the training program, Moldova will have achieved full operational capability in AI safety and governance. The AI Safety Framework will be fully implemented, the Byzantine Council will be operational, and a critical mass of certified professionals will be in place to ensure the long-term success of the initiative.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our global commitment to building a safer AI ecosystem, CSOAI is proud to announce a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free access to our CEASAI certification program for 500,250 individuals worldwide, including the citizens of Moldova. This unprecedented opportunity will enable Moldovans to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to become certified AI Safety Analysts, empowering them to play a leading role in the governance of AI in their country and beyond. By creating a global network of certified professionals, we aim to build immediate capacity for AI safety and foster a culture of responsible innovation. This initiative represents a significant investment in the future of AI, and we are confident that it will have a transformative impact on Moldova and the world.

# AI Safety Framework for Zimbabwe: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Zimbabwe to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. The nation stands at a critical juncture, where the decisions made today will profoundly shape its technological future and economic trajectory. The absence of a national AI strategy until recently has left Zimbabwe, like 117 other countries, in a precarious position, vulnerable to the risks of unregulated AI development and deployment. These risks are not merely theoretical; they encompass everything from algorithmic bias and data privacy violations to job displacement and national security threats. A proactive and robust AI governance framework is not just a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for Zimbabwe to harness the transformative power of AI for sustainable development, while safeguarding the rights and interests of its citizens and businesses. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a clear and actionable path forward, providing a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a proven compliance methodology to empower Zimbabwe to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI-powered future.

## Current State of AI in Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe has recently embarked on a journey of digital transformation, with the government approving its first National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for 2026–2030. This strategy signals a commitment to harnessing AI for economic growth and improved public services. While AI adoption is still in its nascent stages, there are promising signs of innovation across various sectors. Key industries beginning to explore AI applications include agriculture, where AI-powered tools are being developed for precision farming and disease detection, and the financial sector, which is leveraging AI for fraud detection and credit scoring. The healthcare sector is also showing interest in AI for diagnostics and treatment planning. Furthermore, startups and universities are actively engaged in AI research and development, creating local-language chatbots and other innovative solutions. The government's digital transformation initiatives, such as the National ICT Policy 2022-2027 and the establishment of a Cyber Security and Monitoring Center, provide a foundational layer for the growth of a digital economy. The Data Protection Act of 2021, while not specifically an AI regulation, establishes a framework for data governance that will be crucial for the ethical development and deployment of AI systems.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its recent strides in digital policy, Zimbabwe remains one of 118 countries without a dedicated AI governance framework. This gap exposes the nation to significant risks, leaving its citizens and businesses vulnerable to the potential negative impacts of unregulated AI. Without clear ethical guidelines and robust oversight mechanisms, the proliferation of AI technologies could lead to a host of problems, including the amplification of societal biases, the erosion of privacy through mass surveillance, and the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few. For citizens, the absence of AI governance can mean a lack of recourse in the face of algorithmic discrimination or unfair automated decisions. For businesses, it creates an environment of uncertainty, stifling innovation and hindering their ability to compete in the global market. The lack of a national AI safety framework also makes it difficult for Zimbabwe to attract foreign investment and participate fully in the global digital economy. Closing this governance gap is therefore not just a matter of mitigating risks, but of unlocking the full potential of AI to drive inclusive and sustainable growth for all Zimbabweans.

## CSOAI's Solution for Zimbabwe

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) provides a comprehensive, turnkey solution to address Zimbabwe's AI governance gap and accelerate its journey towards a safe and prosperous AI-powered future. Our white-label AI Safety Framework is a ready-to-deploy, customizable governance structure that can be adapted to Zimbabwe's specific needs and regulatory context. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable set of policies, standards, and best practices that have been developed through extensive research and collaboration with global AI experts. To ensure that Zimbabwe has the local expertise to implement and manage this framework, we offer the CEASAI Certification, a world-class training program for AI safety professionals. This program is designed to equip local talent with the skills and knowledge needed to become certified AI Safety Analysts, capable of overseeing the ethical development and deployment of AI systems. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council, a novel approach to AI oversight, provides a decentralized and resilient governance model that is resistant to single points of failure and capture. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry representatives, academics, and civil society members, ensures that a wide range of perspectives are brought to bear on AI governance decisions. Finally, our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI safety, enabling organizations to continuously monitor, assess, and improve their AI systems to ensure they remain safe, fair, and accountable over time.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Zimbabwe, designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance. **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)** will involve a comprehensive review of Zimbabwe's existing legal and regulatory landscape, as well as an assessment of the country's current AI capabilities and infrastructure. This phase will culminate in the development of a detailed and customized implementation plan. **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)** will see the roll-out of the white-label AI Safety Framework across government and key industries. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the adoption of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts** will focus on building local capacity through the CEASAI Certification program. This intensive training initiative will create a new generation of AI safety professionals in Zimbabwe, equipped to manage and oversee the country's AI ecosystem. **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability** will mark the final stage of the implementation process, with the AI Safety Framework fully integrated into Zimbabwe's national innovation system. This will enable the country to confidently pursue its AI ambitions, knowing that it has the necessary safeguards in place to protect its citizens and promote responsible innovation.

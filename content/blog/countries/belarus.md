# AI Safety Framework for Belarus: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Belarus to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been more critical. The nation stands at a pivotal juncture, where the decisions made today will shape its technological future and its position in the global digital economy. The absence of a national AI governance strategy exposes Belarus to significant risks, including the erosion of public trust, stifled innovation, and a growing digital divide. This article outlines the current state of AI in Belarus, identifies the critical governance gap, and presents a robust, white-label solution from the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) to build a resilient and responsible AI ecosystem. By embracing a proactive approach to AI safety, Belarus can not only mitigate potential harms but also unlock immense opportunities for economic growth, social progress, and technological sovereignty. The time to act is now; the future of AI in Belarus depends on it.

## The Current State of AI in Belarus

Belarus is in the nascent stages of an AI-driven transformation, with a growing recognition of artificial intelligence as a catalyst for economic and social development. While the country has a strong foundation in IT and software development, the widespread adoption of AI technologies is still gaining momentum. A 2024-2025 assessment by the UNDP and the Ministry of Communications and Informatization revealed that 43% of the Belarusian population has never used AI technologies, and the country ranks 113th out of 160 in the global AI adaptation index [1]. Despite this, there is a palpable sense of “techno-optimism,” with 57% of Belarusians believing that technology can address major societal and economic challenges [1].

Key industries are beginning to harness the power of AI. In **healthcare**, AI is being deployed for the early diagnosis of diseases. The **finance** and **marketing** sectors are leveraging AI for data analysis and customer service. In **education**, there is a push towards automated distance-learning platforms with adaptive content. The government is also exploring AI applications in **urban services** to optimize operations through big data analysis [2]. Furthermore, the manufacturing sector is witnessing a shift towards automation, exemplified by the recent launch of mass robotic production of AI-powered television sets [3].

The Belarusian government has taken initial steps to foster a digital economy. The “Digital Economy Development Strategy (2019-2025)” and the establishment of the Hi-Tech Park in Minsk have created a fertile ground for tech innovation. However, these initiatives have yet to translate into a comprehensive AI governance framework. While Belarus has spearheaded a model AI law for CIS countries and is in the process of developing national AI standards, a significant 73% of the population remains unaware of government support for AI development, and 67% are not informed about existing AI-related legislation [1]. This highlights a critical need for a more cohesive and visible national AI strategy.

## The AI Governance Gap

Belarus is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This regulatory vacuum presents a significant challenge to the nation's technological advancement and exposes its citizens and businesses to a multitude of risks. Without clear guidelines and standards for the development and deployment of AI, Belarus faces the potential for algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and the misuse of AI for surveillance and social control. The authoritarian political context, as noted by observers, further exacerbates these concerns, limiting public participation in the legislative process and raising questions about transparency and human rights in the age of AI [4].

The absence of a robust AI governance framework can also stifle innovation and economic growth. Businesses may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies without legal clarity and certainty. Moreover, as the European Union and other global powers move towards stringent AI regulations, Belarusian companies may face barriers to accessing international markets if their AI systems do not comply with these emerging standards. The lack of a national AI strategy also contributes to a digital divide, where the benefits of AI are not equitably distributed across society, and a significant portion of the population is left behind in the digital transformation.

## CSOAI's Solution for Belarus

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to address the specific needs and challenges of nations like Belarus. Our solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a customizable framework that can be adapted to the local context, ensuring cultural and legal alignment. The CSOAI framework is built on four key pillars:

1.  **White-label AI Safety Framework:** We provide a ready-to-deploy, comprehensive AI governance framework that can be branded and implemented as a national standard. This framework includes policies, guidelines, and best practices for the ethical and responsible development and deployment of AI.

2.  **CEASAI Certification:** To build local capacity and expertise, we offer the Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation (CEASAI) program. This certification program is designed to train a new generation of AI safety professionals who can lead the implementation and oversight of the national AI framework.

3.  **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** Our innovative governance model proposes the establishment of a decentralized, 33-agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight. This council, composed of diverse stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society, would provide a resilient and tamper-proof mechanism for AI governance, ensuring that no single entity can exert undue influence.

4.  **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** The Safety and Oversight of AI - Plan-Do-Check-Act (SOAI-PDCA) methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI compliance. This methodology enables organizations to continuously assess, improve, and demonstrate their adherence to the national AI safety standards.

By adopting the CSOAI solution, Belarus can rapidly bridge its AI governance gap, foster public trust in AI, and create a safe and prosperous digital future for its citizens.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Belarus, designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition towards a mature AI governance ecosystem.

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of the current AI landscape in Belarus, including a detailed analysis of existing legal and regulatory frameworks, stakeholder mapping, and a national AI readiness assessment. Based on these findings, a detailed implementation plan will be developed in collaboration with key government and industry partners.

*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, the white-label AI Safety Framework will be customized and deployed as the national standard for Belarus. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight and the formal adoption of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months):** To build local capacity, CSOAI will launch a nationwide training program to certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts through the CEASAI program. These certified professionals will form the backbone of the national AI safety ecosystem, providing expertise and support to both public and private sector organizations.

*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** Following the successful completion of the first three phases, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational. This final phase will focus on continuous improvement, ongoing monitoring and evaluation, and the expansion of the AI safety ecosystem to all sectors of the Belarusian economy.

# AI Safety Framework for North Macedonia: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

North Macedonia stands at a critical juncture. The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents immense opportunities for economic growth and societal progress. However, without a robust governance framework, the nation faces significant risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy infringements, and a lack of accountability. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for North Macedonia to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework is now. This framework will not only mitigate risks but also foster an environment of trust and innovation, enabling the country to harness the full potential of AI. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this governance gap, providing a clear path for North Macedonia to become a regional leader in responsible AI.

## Current State of AI in North Macedonia

North Macedonia's journey into the AI era is characterized by a mix of promising initiatives and significant challenges. While the country currently lacks specific AI regulations, the government has demonstrated a strong commitment to digital transformation. The Fund for Innovation and Technology Development (FITD) has been a key driver, promoting AI development through subsidies for startups and innovative AI solutions. A notable achievement is the creation of "ADA," the first Macedonian AI-based digital public administration assistant, showcasing the potential for AI to modernize public services.

The IT sector in North Macedonia is vibrant and growing, supported by competitive labor costs and a high-quality talent pool. However, the absence of a clear AI framework and a shortage of skilled professionals, exacerbated by brain drain, are significant hurdles. The government's "Roadmap for Digital Transformation 2024–2030" is a comprehensive plan to address these issues, with a strong emphasis on building digital infrastructure, enhancing digital skills, and fostering a data-driven culture. This roadmap, which includes initiatives for AI research and development, provides a solid foundation for the adoption of a national AI strategy.

## The AI Governance Gap

North Macedonia is one of 118 countries that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This gap exposes the nation to a range of risks. For citizens, it means a lack of protection from the potential harms of AI, such as discriminatory algorithms in hiring or loan applications, and the misuse of personal data. For businesses, the absence of clear rules creates uncertainty, hindering investment and innovation. The lack of a national AI strategy also means that North Macedonia is not fully prepared to compete in the global digital economy, where AI is a key driver of growth.

Without a governance framework, there is no clear mechanism for ensuring the ethical development and deployment of AI. This can lead to a loss of public trust in AI technologies, which can, in turn, slow down their adoption. Furthermore, as a candidate for EU membership, North Macedonia will be expected to align its legal framework with the EU's AI Act. Proactively establishing a national AI safety framework will not only address the governance gap but also demonstrate the country's commitment to European standards.

## CSOAI's Solution for North Macedonia

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be rapidly deployed in North Macedonia. This framework is designed to be adaptable to the specific needs of the country, providing a clear and practical path to responsible AI governance. At the core of our solution is the CEASAI Certification, a professional qualification for AI safety analysts. By training a local workforce of certified professionals, we can build the in-country capacity needed to oversee the implementation of the AI safety framework.

To ensure robust oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry experts, academics, and civil society representatives, will provide independent oversight of the AI ecosystem. The council will be supported by our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, a continuous improvement model that ensures the AI safety framework remains effective and up-to-date.

## Implementation Roadmap

Our proposed implementation roadmap is designed to deliver a fully operational AI safety framework in North Macedonia within 18 months:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** We will work with stakeholders in North Macedonia to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current AI landscape and develop a detailed implementation plan.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** We will deploy the CSOAI AI Safety Framework, including the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (9 months):** We will launch a nationwide training program to certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts through our CEASAI program.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** The AI safety framework will be fully operational, with ongoing monitoring and support from CSOAI.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building global AI safety capacity, CSOAI is offering a £1 billion training giveaway. Citizens of North Macedonia can access our CEASAI certification program for free, enabling them to become certified AI Safety Analysts.

# AI Safety Framework for Timor-Leste: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Timor-Leste stands at a critical juncture. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence presents immense opportunities for economic growth and societal development. However, without a robust governance framework, the nation is exposed to significant risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and economic disruption. The upcoming EU AI Act, with its deadline of February 2, 2026, will have extraterritorial implications, impacting any Timorese entity that processes data of EU citizens. The time to act is now. This article outlines a comprehensive AI safety framework for Timor-Leste, proposed by the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), to proactively address these challenges. By establishing a national AI strategy, fostering local talent, and implementing a proven compliance methodology, Timor-Leste can harness the power of AI safely and ethically, ensuring a prosperous and secure digital future for its citizens. CSOAI's white-label solution, tailored to Timor-Leste's unique context, offers a clear roadmap to navigate the complexities of AI governance and unlock the nation's full potential in the global digital economy.

## Current State of AI in Timor-Leste

Timor-Leste's journey into the digital age is marked by both progress and challenges. While the government has shown a commitment to digital transformation through initiatives like the 'Timor Digital 2032' plan, the adoption of AI is still in its nascent stages. The nation's digital infrastructure is undergoing a significant upgrade, with the recent installation of a submarine fiber optic cable promising to enhance internet connectivity and speed. This development is a crucial enabler for AI technologies. Currently, AI is being used in a limited capacity within academic institutions for research, in the private sector for applications like climate forecasting, and by a small but growing community of developers. However, systemic integration of AI across key industries such as agriculture, healthcare, and public services is yet to be realized.

The government's focus on e-governance and digital citizenship, supported by partners like the UNDP and the European Union, provides a fertile ground for the introduction of AI-powered solutions. The 'Dalan ba Digital' (Path to Digital) initiative, for instance, aims to improve digital literacy and access to digital services for all citizens. Despite these positive steps, a significant gap remains in the regulatory landscape. Existing technology-related legislation does not specifically address the unique challenges posed by AI. This lack of a dedicated AI policy and the limited availability of local AI talent are major impediments to widespread and responsible AI adoption. The data ecosystem, another critical component for AI development, is also in need of strengthening, with issues of data availability, quality, and interoperability posing significant hurdles.

## The AI Governance Gap

Timor-Leste is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This 'governance gap' exposes the nation to a multitude of risks that could undermine its economic and social progress. Without clear regulations and oversight, the deployment of AI systems can lead to unintended consequences, such as the perpetuation of societal biases, the erosion of privacy, and the displacement of jobs. For citizens, the absence of a framework means they have little to no recourse in the event of AI-related harm. For businesses, the lack of legal clarity creates uncertainty, stifling innovation and investment in AI technologies.

The risks are not merely theoretical. As AI becomes more pervasive globally, Timor-Leste will increasingly interact with AI-powered systems from other countries. Without its own governance framework, the nation will be forced to adopt the standards set by others, which may not align with its own values and priorities. The EU AI Act, for example, will have a direct impact on Timorese businesses that offer goods or services to EU citizens. Non-compliance with this act could result in significant financial penalties and reputational damage. The AI governance gap is not just a matter of policy; it is a matter of national sovereignty and a critical determinant of Timor-Leste's ability to shape its own digital future.

## CSOAI's Solution for Timor-Leste

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to Timor-Leste's specific needs and development goals. Our solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a collaborative partnership to build a sustainable and responsible AI ecosystem. At the core of our offering is the **CEASAI Certification**, a professional qualification designed to create a new generation of AI safety experts within Timor-Leste. This program will equip local professionals with the skills and knowledge to design, develop, and deploy AI systems that are safe, ethical, and aligned with international standards.

To ensure robust oversight and governance, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**. This decentralized body, composed of diverse stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society, will provide independent and impartial oversight of AI development and deployment in the country. The council will be responsible for setting ethical guidelines, reviewing high-risk AI systems, and investigating any incidents of AI-related harm.

Our **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** provides a structured and iterative approach to AI governance. This methodology enables organizations to continuously assess and improve their AI systems, ensuring they remain compliant with evolving regulations and best practices. The SOAI-PDCA framework is a practical tool that helps businesses integrate AI safety into their existing workflows and risk management processes. By adopting CSOAI's solution, Timor-Leste can not only bridge the AI governance gap but also position itself as a leader in responsible AI innovation in the region.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a four-phase implementation roadmap to guide Timor-Leste on its journey to comprehensive AI governance:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase involves a thorough assessment of Timor-Leste's existing digital infrastructure, legal framework, and talent pool. We will work closely with government ministries, private sector stakeholders, and academic institutions to develop a national AI strategy that is aligned with the country's development priorities. This phase will culminate in a detailed action plan with clear timelines and milestones.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will deploy our white-label AI Safety Framework, customizing it to the specific needs of Timor-Leste. This includes establishing the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI and integrating the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology into the workflows of key government agencies and private sector organizations.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months):** The third phase focuses on building local capacity through our CEASAI Certification program. We will train 1,000 AI Safety Analysts from across Timor-Leste, equipping them with the skills to manage and oversee AI systems responsibly. This will create a sustainable pool of local talent to support the long-term growth of the AI ecosystem.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing):** The final phase marks the transition to a fully operational AI governance framework. We will provide ongoing support and guidance to the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the certified AI Safety Analysts, ensuring the framework remains effective and responsive to the evolving challenges of AI.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

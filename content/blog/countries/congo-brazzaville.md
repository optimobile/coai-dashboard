# AI Safety Framework for Congo (Brazzaville): Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Congo (Brazzaville) stands at a critical juncture in its digital transformation journey. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) present a unique opportunity for the nation to accelerate its economic development and improve the lives of its citizens. However, the absence of a comprehensive AI safety and governance framework poses significant risks, potentially hindering innovation and exposing the country to the adverse effects of unregulated AI. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Congo (Brazzaville) to establish a robust AI governance structure is now. A proactive approach will not only mitigate risks but also position the country as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the Central African region. This blog post outlines a clear path forward, leveraging the Council of Safe AI's (CSOAI) white-label AI Safety Framework to build a secure and prosperous digital future for Congo (Brazzaville).

## Current State of AI in Congo (Brazzaville)

The Republic of the Congo is in the nascent stages of an AI-powered transformation, with the government and private sector beginning to explore the potential of this technology to drive economic growth and social development. The country's digital transformation is a national priority, as outlined in the **Congo Digital 2025 plan**, which aims to leverage technology to modernize public services and create a more inclusive digital economy. This has created a fertile ground for AI adoption, particularly in key sectors such as banking and finance.

The **banking sector** has emerged as an early adopter of AI, with financial institutions utilizing machine learning algorithms for fraud detection and credit scoring. Pilot programs in local banks have demonstrated the potential of AI to significantly improve operational efficiency, with fraud detection rates increasing by as much as 35%. Furthermore, AI-powered credit scoring models are being explored as a means to enhance financial inclusion, enabling lenders to extend credit to informal entrepreneurs who lack traditional collateral.

The government's commitment to digital transformation is further evidenced by the establishment of the **African Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (ARCAI)** in Brazzaville. Inaugurated in February 2022, in partnership with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), ARCAI is a testament to the nation's ambition to become a regional hub for AI research and development. The center, located at the Denis Sassou-Nguesso University in Kintélé, is focused on advancing AI with a human-centered approach, ensuring that the technology is used to maximize socio-economic benefits while mitigating potential risks.

Despite these positive developments, Congo (Brazzaville) faces several challenges in its AI journey. A significant **skills gap** remains a major obstacle, with a limited number of professionals trained in advanced AI frameworks. To address this, ARCAI is expanding its training programs, and partnerships are being forged with universities to provide students with access to cutting-edge AI technologies. Infrastructure development is also a key focus, with a new fiber optic ring being built around Brazzaville's data center district to improve connectivity and reduce costs for AI startups.

In terms of regulation, Congo (Brazzaville) has a data protection law, **Law No. 29-2019 of 10 October 2019**, which provides a legal framework for the protection of personal data. However, as of May 2025, the country does not have a comprehensive national law specifically governing Artificial Intelligence. This regulatory gap highlights the urgent need for a robust AI governance framework to ensure the responsible and ethical development and deployment of AI in the country.

## The AI Governance Gap

Congo (Brazzaville) is one of 118 countries worldwide that currently lack a comprehensive national strategy for artificial intelligence. This AI governance gap, if left unaddressed, could have profound and far-reaching consequences for the nation's economy, society, and citizens. Without a clear regulatory framework, the country risks falling behind in the global digital race, unable to fully harness the transformative power of AI while leaving itself vulnerable to a host of ethical, social, and economic challenges.

The absence of a national AI strategy creates a climate of uncertainty for businesses and investors. Without clear guidelines on data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and accountability, companies may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies, stifling innovation and economic growth. This is particularly concerning for a nation like Congo (Brazzaville), which is actively seeking to diversify its economy beyond its traditional reliance on petroleum. A robust AI governance framework would not only attract foreign investment but also foster a vibrant domestic AI ecosystem, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs and skilled professionals.

For citizens, the lack of AI governance raises serious concerns about the protection of their fundamental rights and freedoms. The unregulated use of AI in areas such as surveillance, law enforcement, and social scoring could lead to widespread discrimination, bias, and a chilling effect on freedom of expression. Without a legal framework to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI, citizens may find themselves at the mercy of opaque and unaccountable algorithms, with little recourse in the event of errors or abuse.

Furthermore, the AI governance gap could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. The benefits of AI, if not distributed equitably, could be concentrated in the hands of a few, widening the gap between the rich and the poor. A national AI strategy is therefore essential to ensure that the development and deployment of AI is inclusive and benefits all segments of society. This includes investing in digital literacy and skills training to empower citizens to participate in the AI-driven economy, as well as promoting the use of AI to address pressing social challenges in areas such as healthcare, education, and agriculture.

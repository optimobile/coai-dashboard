# AI Safety Framework for Myanmar: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Myanmar stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) present both immense opportunities and significant risks. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a comprehensive AI safety framework in Myanmar has never been more urgent. The nation is currently among 118 countries without a national AI strategy, leaving its citizens, businesses, and government vulnerable to the potential downsides of unregulated AI. The absence of a robust governance structure can lead to the misuse of AI for surveillance, the amplification of societal biases, and the erosion of fundamental human rights. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for Myanmar to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its potential harms. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a clear path forward, providing a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to Myanmar's unique context. This framework, combined with the CEASAI Certification for local professionals and a robust oversight mechanism, can empower Myanmar to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI-powered future.

## Current State of AI in Myanmar

The landscape of Artificial Intelligence in Myanmar is a study in contrasts. On one hand, there are nascent signs of AI adoption in the private sector, particularly within the banking and telecommunications industries. Government-affiliated companies are exploring AI-powered solutions to enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs. For instance, Burmese-language chatbots are being deployed to improve customer service, while Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is being used for credit scoring and real-time fraud detection. KBZ Bank, a leading financial institution in the country, has notably partnered with FinbotsAI to implement an AI-driven credit scoring system. These developments, while promising, are taking place against a backdrop of significant challenges.

The military's use of AI for surveillance and the suppression of dissent casts a long shadow over the technology's potential for good. Reports from human rights organizations indicate that AI-powered facial recognition and monitoring systems are being used to identify and target opposition members, creating a climate of fear and eroding privacy. This dual-use nature of AI underscores the critical need for a governance framework that can promote responsible innovation while preventing the technology from being weaponized against the population.

The Myanmar government has expressed its ambition to accelerate the nation's digital transformation through the Myanmar Digital Economy Roadmap 2030. However, the country grapples with a substantial digital divide, inadequate infrastructure, and a significant brain drain of skilled professionals. The existing legal framework, including the 2025 Cybersecurity Law, is more focused on control than on fostering a safe and innovative digital environment. This creates a precarious situation where the potential benefits of AI are at risk of being overshadowed by its potential for misuse.

## The AI Governance Gap

Myanmar's absence from the list of countries with a national AI strategy places it in a vulnerable position. This "AI governance gap" is not merely a matter of missing out on the latest technological trend; it represents a significant risk to the nation's economic development, social fabric, and the fundamental rights of its citizens. Without a guiding framework, the adoption of AI is likely to be haphazard, driven by the interests of a few rather than the needs of the many. This can lead to a host of problems, including the perpetuation of existing inequalities, the introduction of new forms of discrimination, and the unchecked use of AI for surveillance and social control.

The lack of a national AI strategy also creates a climate of uncertainty for businesses and investors. Without clear rules of the road, companies are hesitant to invest in AI-powered solutions, fearing legal and reputational risks. This can stifle innovation and prevent Myanmar from realizing the full economic benefits of the AI revolution. Furthermore, the absence of a governance framework leaves the country's citizens with little recourse in the event of AI-related harms. If an AI system makes a biased decision that affects an individual's access to credit, employment, or other opportunities, there is currently no clear mechanism for redress.

The risks of inaction are particularly acute in the context of Myanmar's complex political landscape. The use of AI by the military for surveillance and the suppression of dissent highlights the urgent need for a governance framework that is grounded in democratic values and respect for human rights. A failure to address the AI governance gap could further entrench authoritarianism and undermine the prospects for a more open and just society.

## CSOAI's Solution for Myanmar

In the face of these challenges, the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and actionable solution for Myanmar. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-made yet customizable foundation for building a robust AI governance ecosystem. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable toolkit that can be tailored to Myanmar's specific needs and priorities. It is designed to be implemented in a phased manner, allowing for a gradual and iterative approach to AI governance.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI Certification program, which is designed to build local capacity in AI safety and governance. This program provides individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to design, develop, and deploy AI systems in a safe and ethical manner. By training a cadre of certified AI safety analysts, Myanmar can create a sustainable and self-sufficient AI ecosystem that is not reliant on foreign expertise.

To ensure effective oversight and accountability, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society, would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the AI Safety Framework and ensuring that it is aligned with the public interest. The council's decentralized and consensus-based decision-making process is designed to be resilient to capture by any single interest group.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured and systematic approach to AI governance. This methodology helps organizations to identify, assess, and mitigate AI-related risks in a proactive and ongoing manner. By embedding this methodology into their operations, organizations can ensure that their AI systems are not only compliant with the relevant laws and regulations but also aligned with ethical principles and best practices.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a four-phased approach to the implementation of our AI Safety Framework in Myanmar:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Myanmar's existing AI landscape, including its legal and regulatory framework, its technological infrastructure, and its human capital. Based on this assessment, we will work with local stakeholders to develop a customized implementation plan that is tailored to Myanmar's specific needs and priorities.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will work with the Myanmar government to formally adopt and deploy the AI Safety Framework. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI and the enactment of the necessary laws and regulations.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** This phase will focus on building local capacity in AI safety and governance. We will work with local universities and training institutions to deliver the CEASAI Certification program to at least 1,000 individuals.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In this final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI providing ongoing oversight and the cadre of certified AI safety analysts providing expert support to organizations across the country.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

To kickstart the process of building local capacity in AI safety and governance, the CSOAI is proud to announce a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals globally, including a significant number of places for citizens of Myanmar. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Myanmar to leapfrog other nations and build a world-class AI workforce.

The CEASAI certification program is designed to be accessible to individuals from all backgrounds, regardless of their prior experience with AI. The program is delivered online and can be completed at a self-paced basis. By taking advantage of this free training, the people of Myanmar can acquire the skills and knowledge they need to participate in the AI revolution and shape the future of their country.

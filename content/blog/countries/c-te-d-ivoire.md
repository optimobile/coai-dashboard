# AI Safety Framework for Côte d'Ivoire: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Côte d'Ivoire stands at a pivotal moment. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence presents a transformative opportunity for the nation's economic and social development. However, this potential is matched by significant risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and the potential for misuse. With the European Union's AI Act set to take effect on February 2, 2026, the window for proactive governance is closing. This landmark regulation will have extraterritorial reach, impacting any Ivorian entity that processes data of EU citizens or offers AI-powered services within the EU market. Failure to establish a robust AI safety framework in alignment with international standards will not only expose Côte d'Ivoire to economic and reputational risks but also hinder its ability to harness AI's full potential. The time for Côte d'Ivoire to act is now. By embracing a proactive and comprehensive approach to AI governance, the nation can build a future where AI is a force for inclusive growth, innovation, and societal well-being, while mitigating the inherent risks. This document outlines a clear and actionable roadmap for achieving this critical objective.

## Current State of AI in Côte d'Ivoire

Côte d'Ivoire is making significant strides in embracing the digital age, with artificial intelligence at the forefront of its national agenda. The government's proactive stance is evident in its ambitious digital transformation plan, which aims to create a paperless public sector by 2030 through the "Digital Acceleration Zero Paper 2030" initiative. This commitment is further solidified by the launch of a comprehensive National AI and Data Governance Strategy, a forward-thinking framework designed to foster inclusive growth and ethical innovation. The strategy is built on three core pillars: investing in skills and infrastructure, ensuring the ethical adoption of AI, and promoting digital inclusion for all citizens.

To support these initiatives, the government has allocated a substantial budget for digital transition, with a 37% increase in 2026, amounting to CFA83.2 billion ($145.9 million). A key project underway is the construction of a national data center, a critical piece of infrastructure that will underpin the country's digital ambitions. In terms of regulation, the **Autorité de Régulation des Télécommunications/TIC de Côte d'Ivoire (ARTCI)** serves as the primary regulatory body for the telecommunications and ICT sectors. The nation has also enacted data protection legislation (Law no. 2013-450) to safeguard citizens' personal information.

AI is already beginning to permeate key sectors of the Ivorian economy. In agriculture, AI-powered mobile applications are helping farmers with crop disease detection and providing real-time market information. The finance sector is also experiencing a digital revolution, with mobile money services driving financial inclusion. While these developments are promising, they also highlight the urgent need for a comprehensive AI governance framework to ensure that the benefits of AI are maximized while the risks are effectively managed.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its commendable progress in digital transformation, Côte d'Ivoire is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks that could undermine its economic and social progress. Without clear regulations and oversight, the deployment of AI technologies could lead to algorithmic bias, job displacement, and the erosion of data privacy. For citizens, this could mean facing discrimination in areas such as loan applications or employment, or having their personal data misused without their consent. For businesses, the absence of a clear legal and ethical framework for AI creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and could lead to significant legal and reputational damage.

The lack of a national AI governance framework also has international implications. As the world moves towards greater regulation of AI, with the EU's AI Act setting a new global standard, countries without their own frameworks will find themselves at a disadvantage. They may face barriers to trade and investment, and their citizens and businesses may be excluded from the global digital economy. For Côte d'Ivoire, a nation with a growing technology sector and aspirations to become a regional digital hub, the absence of a robust AI governance framework is a critical vulnerability that must be addressed with urgency.

## CSOAI's Solution for Côte d'Ivoire

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label solution to bridge the AI governance gap in Côte d'Ivoire. Our AI Safety Framework is a turnkey solution that can be rapidly deployed and customized to meet the specific needs of the Ivorian context. It provides a clear and actionable roadmap for developing and implementing a national AI strategy that is aligned with international best practices and regulatory standards, including the EU AI Act.

At the heart of our solution is the **CEASAI Certification**, a professional qualification for AI safety analysts. This program is designed to build local capacity and create a pipeline of skilled professionals who can oversee the ethical development and deployment of AI technologies. By training a cadre of certified experts, Côte d'Ivoire can ensure that it has the human capital required to manage the complexities of AI governance.

To further enhance AI oversight, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**. This innovative governance model provides a decentralized and resilient framework for AI oversight. The council is composed of 33 specialized AI agents, each responsible for monitoring a specific aspect of AI safety, from bias detection to data privacy. This multi-agent system ensures that no single point of failure can compromise the integrity of the AI ecosystem.

Our **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology** provides a structured approach to AI safety and compliance. Based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, this methodology enables organizations to continuously monitor, assess, and improve their AI systems. It provides a clear and auditable trail of compliance activities, giving businesses the confidence to innovate and citizens the assurance that their rights are being protected.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Côte d'Ivoire:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase involves a comprehensive assessment of Côte d'Ivoire's existing digital infrastructure, legal and regulatory landscape, and key industry sectors. This will be followed by the development of a detailed implementation plan, tailored to the specific needs and priorities of the country.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, the AI Safety Framework will be deployed and integrated with existing government systems. This includes the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI and the rollout of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** This phase focuses on building local capacity through the training and certification of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts. These analysts will form the backbone of Côte d'Ivoire's AI governance ecosystem.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In the final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, providing ongoing monitoring, oversight, and support for the responsible development and deployment of AI in Côte d'Ivoire.

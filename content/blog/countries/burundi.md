# AI Safety Framework for Burundi: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Burundi to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been more critical. The nation stands at a pivotal juncture, where the decisions made today will shape its technological future and socioeconomic landscape for decades to come. The absence of a national AI strategy or governance framework exposes Burundi to a multitude of risks, including the unchecked proliferation of biased algorithms, threats to data privacy and security, and the potential for significant economic and social disruption. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance with international standards but a strategic imperative for safeguarding citizens, fostering sustainable innovation, and ensuring that the transformative power of AI is harnessed for the collective good. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a ready-to-deploy, white-label AI Safety Framework, providing Burundi with a unique opportunity to leapfrog common development hurdles and establish a world-class governance model that is tailored to its specific needs and aspirations.

## The Current State of AI in Burundi

Burundi's engagement with artificial intelligence is still in its nascent stages, yet the technology is beginning to permeate various sectors of its economy and society. While comprehensive data on AI adoption remains limited, emerging trends indicate a growing awareness of AI's potential and a burgeoning ecosystem of innovation. The country's scientific community is actively contributing to the global AI knowledge base, with 45 AI-related research papers published in 2024, accounting for a notable 7.8% of its total scientific output. This scholarly interest underscores a foundational curiosity and a desire to explore the applications of AI in a local context.

In the education sector, there are proactive efforts to integrate AI into the curriculum, with some institutions having done so since 2018. This forward-looking approach recognizes the increasing demand for AI-related skills in the global job market and aims to equip the next generation of Burundian professionals with the expertise needed to thrive in a technology-driven world. The private sector is also beginning to embrace AI, with web developers and other tech entrepreneurs leveraging AI-powered tools to enhance productivity and efficiency. These early adopters are demonstrating the tangible benefits of AI, from accelerating software development cycles to automating complex tasks.

The Burundian government has signaled its commitment to digital transformation through initiatives such as the Master Plan for the Digitalization of Public Services (2023-2033) and the validation of the country's first National Data Governance Strategy in November 2025. These strategic frameworks, while not exclusively focused on AI, lay the essential groundwork for a data-driven economy and provide a platform for the future integration of AI in public administration. However, significant challenges remain, most notably the low internet penetration rate of just 12.5%, which poses a substantial barrier to widespread AI adoption and digital inclusion. Addressing this digital divide is a critical prerequisite for unlocking the full potential of AI in Burundi.

## The AI Governance Gap

Burundi is one of 118 countries worldwide that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This regulatory vacuum creates a precarious environment where the development and deployment of AI systems can proceed without adequate oversight, accountability, or ethical considerations. The absence of a national AI strategy leaves the country vulnerable to a range of risks, including the perpetuation of algorithmic bias, the erosion of data privacy, and the potential for AI-driven technologies to be used for malicious purposes. For citizens, this could translate into discriminatory outcomes in areas such as loan applications, hiring processes, and even criminal justice. For businesses, the lack of clear regulatory guidelines creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and may deter foreign investment.

Without a robust governance framework, Burundi also risks falling behind in the global digital economy. As other nations race to develop and implement AI strategies, those that fail to keep pace may find themselves at a significant competitive disadvantage. The EU AI Act, with its fast-approaching deadline, is set to become a global benchmark for AI regulation, and its influence will undoubtedly extend beyond the borders of the European Union. Burundian businesses that wish to operate in or with the EU market will need to comply with its stringent requirements, making the adoption of a comparable domestic framework a matter of economic necessity.

## CSOAI's Solution for Burundi

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) presents a comprehensive and readily deployable solution to address Burundi's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework is a turnkey system that can be customized to meet the specific needs and cultural context of the nation. It provides a robust and adaptable structure for governing the development, deployment, and use of AI, ensuring that these technologies are aligned with Burundi's values and development goals.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI Certification program, a globally recognized qualification for AI safety professionals. Through this program, we aim to train and certify a new generation of Burundian AI Safety Analysts, creating a skilled workforce that can oversee the implementation of the national AI framework and ensure its ongoing effectiveness. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council, a decentralized and resilient oversight body, provides an additional layer of governance, ensuring that the framework remains robust and adaptable in the face of evolving technological challenges.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology offers a structured and iterative approach to AI governance, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation. This proven methodology, which has been successfully implemented in various contexts worldwide, provides a clear roadmap for organizations to achieve and maintain compliance with the national AI safety standards. By adopting the CSOAI solution, Burundi can not only bridge its current governance gap but also position itself as a regional leader in responsible AI innovation.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Burundi, designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition towards a mature AI governance ecosystem.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

This initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Burundi's existing technological infrastructure, legal and regulatory landscape, and institutional capacity. Working in close collaboration with government stakeholders, we will identify key priorities, define specific goals, and develop a detailed implementation plan that is tailored to the nation's unique context.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In this phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework, customizing it to align with Burundi's national development goals and legal traditions. This will involve the establishment of the necessary regulatory bodies, the development of specific guidelines and standards, and the integration of the framework with existing government systems.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

This phase will focus on building local capacity through the training and certification of 1,000 Burundian AI Safety Analysts. The CEASAI certification program will equip these professionals with the skills and knowledge needed to oversee the implementation of the AI framework and ensure its long-term sustainability.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

In the final phase, the AI Safety Framework will become fully operational, with all necessary systems, processes, and personnel in place. This will mark a significant milestone in Burundi's journey towards becoming a leader in responsible AI governance, creating a safe and prosperous digital future for all its citizens.

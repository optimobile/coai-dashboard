# AI Safety Framework for Dominican Republic: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

The Dominican Republic stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents immense opportunities for economic growth and societal advancement. However, without a robust governance framework, it also brings significant risks. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for the Dominican Republic to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework is now. This urgency is not merely about compliance with international standards but about proactively shaping a future where AI is a tool for inclusive and sustainable development. A national AI safety framework will enable the Dominican Republic to mitigate risks, build trust, and confidently harness the transformative power of AI, ensuring that the benefits are shared by all citizens and businesses.

## Current State of AI in the Dominican Republic

The Dominican Republic is experiencing a steady increase in AI adoption, with nearly 70% of the population using AI more than once a week [1]. This high level of engagement is a testament to the country's readiness to embrace new technologies. Key industries leveraging AI include tourism, finance, healthcare, and retail, where it is used to enhance customer experiences, optimize operations, and drive innovation. The government has also demonstrated a strong commitment to digital transformation through initiatives like the National Innovation Policy 2030 and the recent strategic alliance with NVIDIA to establish a Center of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence [2]. This partnership aims to accelerate AI adoption in critical sectors such as healthcare, education, and public safety. While the Dominican Republic has made significant strides in its digital journey, the absence of a dedicated AI governance framework creates a gap that needs to be addressed to ensure responsible and ethical AI deployment.

## The AI Governance Gap

The Dominican Republic is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This gap exposes the nation to a range of risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and job displacement. Without clear regulations, citizens and businesses are vulnerable to the potential negative impacts of AI, which could erode public trust and hinder its long-term adoption. The lack of a national framework also poses a challenge for businesses seeking to compete in the global market, as they may face difficulties in complying with international standards like the EU AI Act. Closing this governance gap is essential for the Dominican Republic to unlock the full potential of AI while safeguarding the rights and interests of its people.

## CSOAI's Solution for the Dominican Republic

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to the specific needs of the Dominican Republic. Our solution is built on four key pillars:

*   **White-label AI Safety Framework:** A customizable framework that provides the policies, standards, and guidelines for responsible AI development and deployment.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A professional certification program for local AI safety analysts, creating a skilled workforce to oversee and manage AI systems.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** A decentralized governance model that brings together diverse stakeholders to ensure a balanced and ethical approach to AI oversight.
*   **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A continuous improvement methodology (Plan-Do-Check-Act) that helps organizations to systematically manage and enhance their AI safety practices.

This integrated solution empowers the Dominican Republic to build a robust and resilient AI ecosystem that fosters innovation while ensuring safety, fairness, and accountability.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a four-phased approach to implement the AI Safety Framework in the Dominican Republic:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current AI landscape and develop a detailed implementation plan in collaboration with key stakeholders.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** Deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework and establish the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** Launch the CEASAI certification program and train a cohort of 1,000 AI safety analysts to build local capacity.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** Achieve full operational capability of the AI Safety Framework, with ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and improvement.

# AI Safety Framework for Albania: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Albania stands at a critical juncture. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the nation must act decisively to establish a robust AI safety framework. The recent appointment of an AI minister and significant investments in AI initiatives signal a commitment to digital transformation. However, this momentum must be channeled into a structured governance model to mitigate risks and unlock the full potential of AI. A national AI safety framework is not merely a matter of compliance; it is a strategic imperative to ensure that AI development is aligned with Albania's economic and social goals, fostering public trust and ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared by all citizens. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label solution to bridge this governance gap and empower Albania to build a secure and prosperous AI-powered future.

## The Current State of AI in Albania

Albania is a nation on the cusp of a technological revolution. The government's forward-thinking approach, exemplified by the appointment of the world's first AI minister, 'Diella,' in September 2025, has placed the country in the global spotlight [1]. This bold move, coupled with an 8.8 million euro investment in Machine Thinking Lab, a startup founded by Albanian-American entrepreneur Mira Murati, underscores a strong commitment to embracing AI as a cornerstone of national development [1].

This commitment is further evidenced by the ambitious 'Digital Agenda of Albania 2022–2026,' a strategic plan to accelerate the country's digital transformation [2]. A key achievement of this agenda is the e-Albania portal, which now offers over 95% of government services online, saving citizens and businesses significant time and money [3]. The government is also collaborating with international partners, such as French consulting firm Inetum Consulting, to develop and implement a national AI strategy. This strategy focuses on 'green AI' and aims to establish Albania as a European hub for sustainable artificial intelligence, with projects including an AI factory and a data hub for tourism and mobility [4].

Despite these promising government-led initiatives, AI adoption within the private sector remains at a nascent stage. A 2025 report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) highlights that while Albanian firms are beginning to explore AI technologies, the overall adoption rate is low compared to more developed economies [5]. The report notes that younger companies and those with younger leadership are more likely to be early adopters. Key sectors showing potential for AI-driven modernization include healthcare, agriculture, public administration, and tourism [4]. The information and communication technology (ICT) sector, with over 1,200 companies, is a critical driver of this transformation [6].

However, significant challenges remain. A notable 'digital skills gap' persists, with a 2025 EBRD report indicating that less than 40% of Albanian youth possess sufficient digital literacy to fully leverage AI technologies [5]. This skills shortage, combined with high rates of emigration, presents a substantial obstacle to widespread AI adoption and innovation. While Albania has made strides in data protection by aligning its legal framework with the EU's GDPR, a comprehensive, AI-specific regulatory framework is still lacking [7]. The existing cybersecurity law, Law No. 25/2024, provides a foundation, but it does not address the unique ethical and societal challenges posed by artificial intelligence [8].

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its ambitious strides in AI adoption, Albania finds itself among the 118 nations, primarily in the Global South, that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework [9]. This gap between technological advancement and regulatory oversight presents significant risks to the nation's economic and social fabric. Without a clear and robust governance structure, Albania risks navigating the complexities of the AI era without a map, potentially leading to unintended consequences that could undermine public trust and hinder long-term progress.

The absence of a national AI strategy and dedicated legislation creates a volatile environment for both citizens and businesses. For citizens, the lack of regulation translates to a lack of protection. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability for AI-driven decisions remain unaddressed, leaving individuals vulnerable to potential misuse of their personal information and discriminatory outcomes. The opacity of some AI systems, as highlighted by critics of Albania's AI minister, can further erode public trust and create a sense of powerlessness [10].

For businesses, the governance gap creates uncertainty and stifles innovation. Without clear guidelines on the ethical and legal use of AI, companies are hesitant to invest in and deploy AI solutions, fearing potential legal and reputational risks. This uncertainty can put Albanian businesses at a competitive disadvantage, both domestically and internationally. Furthermore, as the EU AI Act comes into full force, Albanian companies that wish to operate within the EU market will be required to comply with its stringent regulations. The lack of a national framework makes it difficult for businesses to prepare for and navigate these new requirements, potentially limiting their access to the lucrative EU market.

This decentralized, multi-agent system provides a resilient and tamper-proof mechanism for monitoring AI systems, detecting potential risks, and ensuring that AI development remains aligned with human values. The Byzantine Council's fault-tolerant design ensures that even in the face of unforeseen challenges, the integrity of Albania's AI governance framework will be maintained.

Finally, our **SOAI-PDCA (Safety of AI - Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** provides a clear and actionable roadmap for businesses and government agencies to ensure that their AI systems are compliant with the national AI safety framework. This iterative, risk-based approach enables organizations to continuously improve their AI safety posture, adapt to emerging threats, and demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI. By adopting the CSOAI's solution, Albania can not only meet its immediate regulatory challenges but also lay the groundwork for a future where AI is a powerful force for good, driving economic growth, social progress, and a better quality of life for all Albanians.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Albania, ensuring a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Albania's existing legal and institutional landscape, as well as its current AI capabilities and challenges. This will be followed by the development of a detailed implementation plan, tailored to Albania's specific needs and priorities. This phase will be conducted in close collaboration with Albanian stakeholders, including government agencies, industry representatives, and civil society organizations.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In the second phase, the white-label AI Safety Framework will be deployed and integrated into Albania's legal and regulatory system. This will include the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight and the formal launch of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. A nationwide awareness campaign will be launched to educate the public and businesses about the new framework and its benefits.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months)**

The third phase will focus on building local capacity through the CEASAI Certification program. The goal is to train and certify at least 1,000 AI Safety Analysts within the first year. These analysts will form the backbone of Albania's AI governance ecosystem, providing the expertise needed to ensure the safe and ethical development and deployment of AI across all sectors.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (Ongoing)**

In the final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with all components working in synergy to ensure the responsible development of AI in Albania. This will be an ongoing process of continuous improvement, with regular reviews and updates to the framework to ensure that it remains effective in the face of new and emerging challenges.

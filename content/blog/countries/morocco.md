# AI Safety Framework for Morocco: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act set to take effect on February 2, 2026, the urgency for Morocco to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. The nation stands at a critical juncture, facing both the immense opportunities of the AI-driven economy and the significant risks of falling behind in the global regulatory landscape. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to ensure that AI is adopted safely, ethically, and for the benefit of all Moroccans. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this gap, providing a clear roadmap for Morocco to build a robust and resilient AI ecosystem. By implementing a national AI safety framework now, Morocco can safeguard its citizens, empower its businesses, and solidify its position as a leader in the region's digital transformation. This is a pivotal moment to transform regulatory challenges into a competitive advantage, fostering innovation while ensuring that AI development aligns with the nation's values and priorities.

## The Current State of AI in Morocco

Morocco is at a fascinating and pivotal moment in its journey with artificial intelligence. While a significant portion of the population is not yet familiar with the intricacies of AI, the country is experiencing a rapid and dynamic digital transformation that is paving the way for widespread AI adoption. A 2024-2025 survey by the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (ANRT) revealed that while 61.4% of Moroccans are unfamiliar with AI, usage is surging, particularly in urban centers where nearly one in three residents has interacted with AI tools. This has resulted in an impressive growth of over 1.2 million new AI users in a single year, a clear indicator of the technology's increasing integration into daily life.

This digital shift is supported by strong fundamentals, including 31.5 million internet users and 30.7 million smartphone holders. The e-commerce sector has also seen a 65% increase in online buyers since 2019, demonstrating a growing comfort with digital transactions and services. This expanding digital ecosystem provides a fertile ground for AI-powered solutions to take root and flourish.

Several key industries are already harnessing the power of AI to drive innovation and efficiency. In the financial sector, AI has led to a 30% reduction in transaction handling times, and the digital banking sector is projected to reach an impressive MAD 76.51 billion by 2028. The healthcare industry is also embracing AI, with nearly half of all hospitals using it for scheduling and 30% for assisting in diagnoses. This has contributed to a 30% rise in robotic surgeries between 2020 and 2024, showcasing the tangible impact of AI on improving healthcare outcomes. Other sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and phosphate processing, are also beginning to explore and implement AI solutions to enhance their operations and competitiveness.

The Moroccan government is actively fostering this technological advancement through its ambitious "Digital Morocco 2030" strategy. With a budget of MAD 9.95 billion, this plan aims to create 240,000 digital jobs by 2030 and is a testament to the government's commitment to a digital future. Key initiatives include the development of a national AI roadmap, the establishment of a sovereign cloud infrastructure by 2026, and the creation of a network of JAZARI institutes dedicated to AI research and development. In terms of regulation, Morocco has already enacted Law 09-08 for data protection and Law 05-20 for cybersecurity, and has recently finalized a comprehensive regulatory framework for the safe and ethical use of AI. These proactive measures demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of a balanced approach that encourages innovation while mitigating potential risks.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its significant strides in digital transformation and initial regulatory efforts, Morocco finds itself in a precarious position, sharing a common challenge with 118 other nations: the absence of a comprehensive, internationally recognized AI governance framework. While foundational laws for data protection and cybersecurity are in place, and a national AI strategy is taking shape, a critical governance gap remains. This gap is not just a matter of missing legislation; it represents a vulnerability to a range of risks that could undermine the nation's progress and expose its citizens and businesses to unforeseen consequences.

The primary risk of this governance vacuum is the potential for unregulated AI development and deployment. Without clear rules of the road, there is a danger of AI systems being developed that are biased, unsafe, or used for malicious purposes. This could lead to a host of negative outcomes, from discriminatory hiring practices and unfair credit scoring to the spread of misinformation and the erosion of public trust. For citizens, the impact could be profound, affecting their fundamental rights, privacy, and economic well-being. For businesses, the lack of a clear regulatory environment creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and could lead to significant legal and reputational damage.

Furthermore, as the world moves towards greater regulation of AI, exemplified by the EU's AI Act, the absence of a comparable framework in Morocco could create significant trade and investment barriers. Moroccan companies seeking to do business with the EU will be required to comply with its stringent AI regulations. Without a national framework to guide them, they will face a significant competitive disadvantage. This could limit their access to global markets and hinder the growth of the nation's burgeoning tech sector. The AI governance gap is, therefore, not just a domestic issue but a matter of international competitiveness and economic security.

## CSOAI's Solution for Morocco

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) provides a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Morocco's AI governance gap and propel the nation into a position of leadership in the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence. Our white-label AI Safety Framework is a turnkey solution designed to be seamlessly integrated into Morocco's existing legal and regulatory landscape.

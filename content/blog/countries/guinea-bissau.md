# AI Safety Framework for Guinea-Bissau: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Guinea-Bissau to establish a national AI safety framework has never been more critical. As one of 118 countries currently without a formal AI governance structure, Guinea-Bissau stands at a pivotal juncture. The rapid global proliferation of artificial intelligence presents both unprecedented opportunities for economic growth and significant risks of misuse and unintended consequences. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to safeguard citizens, foster trust in digital transformation, and unlock the full potential of AI for sustainable development. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label solution designed to bridge this governance gap, providing Guinea-Bissau with the tools, training, and expertise to build a robust and resilient AI ecosystem. This framework will enable the nation to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks, ensuring that technological advancement aligns with the values and interests of its people.

## Current State of AI in Guinea-Bissau

Guinea-Bissau is at the nascent stages of AI adoption, but the government has demonstrated a clear commitment to digital transformation, creating a fertile ground for the integration of artificial intelligence. The nation's digital journey is characterized by a focus on leveraging technology to address fundamental challenges in sectors such as healthcare, public administration, and education. While comprehensive data on AI adoption remains limited, several key initiatives and trends indicate the direction in which the country is heading.

In the healthcare sector, Guinea-Bissau is collaborating with the World Health Organization (WHO) to explore the use of AI for improving diagnostics, treatment, and drug tracking. This initiative is part of a broader digital health strategy aimed at enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of healthcare services for all citizens. The use of AI in this context has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery in a country that has historically faced significant challenges in this area.

The government's embrace of blockchain technology for fiscal transparency and wage bill management, with support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), showcases a willingness to adopt cutting-edge technologies to improve governance and reduce corruption. While not a direct application of AI, this initiative demonstrates a foundational understanding of the importance of data integrity and secure digital infrastructure, which are essential prerequisites for a thriving AI ecosystem.

In the realm of education, there are emerging conversations about leveraging AI to personalize learning and bridge educational gaps. Organizations are exploring strategic roadmaps for AI integration tailored to the unique context of Guinea-Bissau, aiming to unleash the transformative power of AI in the education sector. Furthermore, as a member of the PALOP (Portuguese-speaking African countries) community, Guinea-Bissau is part of a regional dialogue on the need to develop digital and technical skills to meet the demands of the 21st-century economy, with AI-enabled training tools being a key area of focus.

Despite these positive developments, Guinea-Bissau's AI landscape is still in its infancy. The country's contribution to global AI research is minimal, and there is a significant need to build local capacity and expertise. The existing technology regulations are not yet specifically tailored to address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by AI. However, the government's proactive stance on digital transformation, as evidenced by its national digital strategy and the World Bank's digital economy diagnostic, provides a strong foundation for the development of a comprehensive AI governance framework.

## The AI Governance Gap

Guinea-Bissau is one of 118 countries that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks that could undermine its economic development, social stability, and the fundamental rights of its citizens. Without a clear set of rules and regulations governing the development and deployment of AI, there is a significant risk of algorithmic bias, which could perpetuate and even exacerbate existing social inequalities. For example, AI systems used in areas such as credit scoring or hiring could discriminate against certain groups of people, limiting their access to economic opportunities.

Furthermore, the absence of a governance framework creates uncertainty for businesses, which may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies without clear legal and ethical guidelines. This can stifle innovation and prevent Guinea-Bissau from reaping the full economic benefits of the AI revolution. The lack of a framework also exposes the country to the risk of becoming a testing ground for unethical AI applications, or a dumping ground for AI technologies that have been deemed unsafe or unfair in other jurisdictions.

For citizens, the AI governance gap translates into a lack of protection against the potential harms of AI. This includes everything from the spread of misinformation and disinformation to the erosion of privacy through the misuse of personal data. In a world where AI is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the absence of a robust governance framework is not just a policy oversight; it is a direct threat to the well-being and autonomy of individuals.

## CSOAI's Solution for Guinea-Bissau

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, turnkey solution to address Guinea-Bissau's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework is designed to be rapidly deployed and customized to the specific needs and context of the nation. This framework provides a clear and actionable roadmap for developing, deploying, and managing AI technologies in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable system that can evolve with the changing technological landscape.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI (Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation) certification program. This program is designed to build local capacity by training a new generation of AI safety professionals in Guinea-Bissau. These certified experts will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to oversee the implementation of the AI safety framework, conduct risk assessments, and ensure that AI systems are aligned with the country's values and priorities. The CEASAI certification is a crucial component of our strategy to create a sustainable and self-sufficient AI ecosystem in Guinea-Bissau.

To ensure robust and impartial oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders including government officials, industry representatives, academics, and civil society leaders, will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the AI safety framework and making key decisions about the future of AI in Guinea-Bissau. The Byzantine fault-tolerant structure of the council is designed to ensure that it can continue to function effectively even in the face of disagreement or disruption, providing a resilient and trustworthy governance mechanism.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI governance. This methodology enables organizations to continuously monitor, evaluate, and improve their AI systems to ensure that they remain safe, effective, and compliant with the established framework. The SOAI-PDCA cycle is a dynamic and adaptive process that allows for continuous learning and improvement, ensuring that Guinea-Bissau's AI governance framework remains relevant and effective in the long term.

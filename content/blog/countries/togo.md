# AI Safety Framework for Togo: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary (200 words)

Togo stands at a critical juncture. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence presents immense opportunities for economic growth and societal progress. However, without a robust governance framework, the nation also faces significant risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and economic disruption. The European Union's AI Act, with its fast-approaching February 2, 2026 deadline, has created a new sense of urgency for countries like Togo to establish their own AI safety protocols. This is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative. A national AI safety framework will enable Togo to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks, fostering innovation, and building trust among citizens and businesses. The time for Togo to act is now, to ensure that the development and deployment of AI aligns with its national values and priorities, securing a prosperous and equitable digital future for all its citizens.

## Current State of AI in Togo (500 words)

Togo has made significant strides in its digital transformation journey, recognizing the pivotal role of technology in its economic development. The government has been proactive in laying the groundwork for a thriving digital economy, with initiatives such as the National Digital Transformation Strategy (2021) and the "Grand Atelier du Digital" (2024). These efforts have created a fertile environment for the adoption of artificial intelligence across various sectors. While still in its nascent stages, AI is beginning to make its mark in Togo, particularly in public administration, where data analysis tools and automation are being leveraged to enhance efficiency and service delivery. A notable example is the use of AI in the Novissi social protection program, which has helped to refine the targeting of cash transfers to vulnerable populations.

The key industries embracing AI in Togo are agriculture, education, healthcare, renewable energy, and logistics. In agriculture, AI-powered solutions are being explored to optimize crop yields, manage resources, and improve food security. In healthcare, AI holds the promise of enhancing diagnostics, personalizing treatment plans, and improving access to quality care. The education sector is also looking to AI to modernize learning methods and bridge skills gaps. Furthermore, Togo's ambition to become a regional logistics hub is being bolstered by the potential of AI to optimize supply chains and streamline operations.

The Togolese government's commitment to digital transformation is evident in its various initiatives aimed at fostering innovation and building a robust digital ecosystem. The establishment of the Data Lab in Lomé, in partnership with the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA), is a testament to this commitment. The Data Lab aims to leverage data and AI for evidence-based policymaking and to train a new generation of local data scientists. However, the regulatory landscape for technology is still evolving. While Togo has enacted laws on cybersecurity (2018) and personal data protection (2019), a comprehensive legal and ethical framework for AI is yet to be established. This governance gap needs to be addressed to ensure that the development and deployment of AI in Togo are guided by principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability.

## The AI Governance Gap (400 words)

Togo is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This gap is not unique to Togo; many nations are grappling with the challenge of keeping pace with the rapid advancements in AI technology. However, the absence of a clear regulatory and ethical framework for AI poses significant risks to Togo's economic and social fabric. Without proper oversight, the deployment of AI systems could lead to a host of unintended consequences, including the amplification of existing biases, the erosion of privacy, and the displacement of jobs. For citizens, the lack of AI governance could mean exposure to unfair or discriminatory treatment by algorithmic systems in areas such as credit scoring, hiring, and even criminal justice. For businesses, the absence of clear rules and standards could create uncertainty, stifle innovation, and expose them to legal and reputational risks.

The potential impact of the AI governance gap extends beyond the domestic sphere. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the lack of a national AI framework could hinder Togo's ability to participate fully in the global digital economy. It could also make the country more vulnerable to the influence of foreign actors who may not share its values or priorities. The EU AI Act, with its extraterritorial reach, underscores the growing importance of international alignment on AI governance. By failing to act, Togo risks being left behind in a world where AI is becoming a key determinant of economic competitiveness and national security. The time has come for Togo to bridge the AI governance gap and to chart its own course in the age of artificial intelligence. This will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including the government, the private sector, civil society, and academia, to develop a national AI strategy that is both ambitious and responsible.

## CSOAI's Solution for Togo (600 words)

In response to the urgent need for AI governance in Togo, the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution designed to empower the nation to build a safe and prosperous digital future. At the heart of our offering is a white-label AI Safety Framework, a ready-to-deploy set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be tailored to Togo's specific needs and cultural context. This framework provides a clear roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of AI, addressing key issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable toolkit that can evolve with the rapidly changing landscape of AI.

To ensure the effective implementation of the AI Safety Framework, CSOAI also offers the CEASAI Certification program, a professional credential for AI safety analysts. This program is designed to equip local professionals with the skills and knowledge they need to assess the safety and compliance of AI systems. By building a cadre of certified AI safety experts in Togo, we can create a sustainable and self-reliant ecosystem for AI governance. The CEASAI certification is more than just a training program; it is a pathway to creating high-value jobs and fostering a culture of AI safety and responsibility.

To provide robust oversight and ensure the impartial application of the AI Safety Framework, CSOAI proposes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight. This innovative governance model is inspired by the principles of distributed consensus and is designed to be resilient to corruption and undue influence. The council would be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including representatives from the government, the private sector, civil society, and academia. Its primary role would be to review and approve AI systems for deployment, to investigate incidents of AI-related harm, and to make recommendations for improving the AI Safety Framework.

Finally, to ensure that the AI Safety Framework is not just a set of abstract principles but a practical and effective tool for managing AI risks, CSOAI has developed the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. This methodology, which is based on the well-established Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, provides a structured approach to AI safety and compliance. It enables organizations to systematically identify, assess, and mitigate AI risks, and to continuously improve their AI governance practices. The SOAI-PDCA methodology is a powerful tool for building trust and confidence in AI, and for ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared by all.

# AI Safety Framework for Bhutan: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Bhutan, a nation renowned for its unique development philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH), stands at a critical juncture in the digital age. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) present both immense opportunities and significant risks. With the European Union's AI Act set to establish a global benchmark for AI regulation by its February 2, 2026 deadline, the urgency for Bhutan to establish a robust AI safety framework has never been more pronounced. The nation's nascent AI ecosystem, while promising, currently lacks the comprehensive governance structures necessary to mitigate potential harms and ensure that AI development aligns with GNH principles. This article outlines a clear and actionable path for Bhutan to proactively shape its AI future. By embracing a tailored AI safety framework, Bhutan can not only safeguard its citizens and businesses but also position itself as a leader in ethical AI adoption, fostering innovation and sustainable development for generations to come. The time to act is now; the future of AI in Bhutan depends on the foundational steps taken today.

## The Current State of AI in Bhutan

Bhutan's journey with Artificial Intelligence is in its early, yet active, stages, reflecting a deliberate and thoughtful approach to adopting transformative technologies. The Royal Government of Bhutan has recognized AI as a critical enabler for its national development goals, with a strong emphasis on aligning technological progress with the country's GNH philosophy. The recently published Bhutan National AI Strategy (NAIS) underscores this commitment, outlining a roadmap to move from the 'active' to the 'systemic' stage of AI maturity by the end of the 13th Five-Year Plan. This strategic vision is supported by a growing ecosystem of government initiatives, private sector innovation, and international collaborations.

At the forefront of AI adoption are several key industries. In the **tourism sector**, AI is being explored to enhance visitor experiences through personalized services and to optimize marketing efforts by analyzing tourism trends. The **agriculture and livestock sector**, which forms the backbone of Bhutan's rural economy, is also beginning to leverage AI for smart farming practices, including crop monitoring and disease prediction, to improve yields and food security. Furthermore, the **energy sector**, a cornerstone of Bhutan's economy, is investigating AI-powered solutions for optimizing energy management and exploring the potential of green data centers.

The government's digital transformation initiatives are a significant driving force behind AI adoption. The GovTech Agency is actively promoting the use of AI in public service delivery to enhance efficiency and citizen satisfaction. Initiatives such as the 'AI for Development' workshop, launched in collaboration with the UAE, aim to build local capacity and unlock AI's potential for economic growth. While Bhutan does not yet have a comprehensive, standalone AI regulation, the NAIS highlights the importance of establishing a robust governance and regulatory framework. Existing technology-related policies, such as the National Cybersecurity Strategy, provide a foundation for addressing some of the risks associated with AI. However, the AI Governance Gap remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure the safe and ethical deployment of AI in the Land of the Thunder Dragon.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its forward-thinking approach to digital transformation, Bhutan finds itself among 118 nations, primarily in the Global South, that currently lack a formal, comprehensive AI governance framework. This gap, as highlighted in a recent UNCTAD report, is not unique to Bhutan but represents a broader global challenge where the rapid pace of technological advancement has outstripped the development of regulatory and ethical oversight mechanisms. The absence of such a framework exposes Bhutan to a range of risks that could undermine its development goals and the well-being of its citizens.

Without a clear AI governance structure, Bhutan faces several potential perils. The proliferation of unregulated AI systems could lead to the erosion of privacy, as personal data is collected and used without adequate safeguards. Algorithmic bias, if left unchecked, could perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas such as employment, finance, and justice. Furthermore, the lack of a framework for accountability and transparency in AI decision-making can erode public trust and create uncertainty for businesses looking to invest in and deploy AI technologies. From a national security perspective, the absence of AI governance can leave the country vulnerable to cyber threats and the malicious use of AI.

The impact of this governance gap extends to both citizens and businesses. For citizens, it means a lack of protection against the potential harms of AI, from the spread of misinformation to the loss of jobs due to automation. For businesses, the absence of clear rules and standards creates a climate of uncertainty, stifling innovation and making it difficult to compete in the global digital economy. Without a national AI safety framework, Bhutanese businesses may also face challenges in accessing international markets, particularly those with stringent AI regulations like the European Union. Closing this governance gap is therefore not just a matter of risk mitigation; it is a strategic imperative for ensuring that AI serves as a force for good in Bhutan, driving inclusive and sustainable development in line with the principles of Gross National Happiness.

## CSOAI's Solution for Bhutan

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Bhutan's AI governance gap and empower the nation to harness the full potential of AI safely and ethically. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy governance structure that can be tailored to Bhutan's unique cultural and developmental context, ensuring alignment with the principles of Gross National Happiness. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable system that can evolve with the country's needs and the changing global AI landscape.

At the heart of our solution is the **CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts) Certification**, a globally recognized program designed to build a cadre of local AI safety experts. By training and certifying Bhutanese professionals, we aim to create a self-sustaining ecosystem of AI governance, reducing reliance on foreign expertise and fostering local ownership of the nation's AI future. This initiative is complemented by the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight**, a decentralized and resilient governance body inspired by the TC260 framework. This council, composed of specialized AI agents and human experts, will provide continuous monitoring and risk assessment of AI systems across the country, ensuring that they operate within ethical and legal boundaries.

To ensure effective implementation and compliance, we introduce the **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology**, a proven and iterative approach to AI safety management. This methodology provides a structured process for organizations to assess their AI risks, implement mitigation measures, and continuously improve their AI safety posture. By adopting the SOAI-PDCA cycle, Bhutanese businesses and government agencies can build a culture of AI safety and demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI development. Together, these components of the CSOAI solution provide Bhutan with a clear and actionable path to building a world-class AI safety framework that is both effective and aligned with its national values.

# AI Safety Framework for Cuba: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Cuba to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. The EU AI Act will have extraterritorial effects, impacting any entity that provides AI systems or services to the European market. For Cuba to remain competitive and avoid being isolated in the global digital economy, it must align its AI governance with international standards. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this gap, providing a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a clear implementation roadmap. This will not only ensure compliance but also foster innovation, protect citizens, and create a new generation of AI safety experts in Cuba.

## The Current State of AI in Cuba

Cuba's journey into the world of artificial intelligence is marked by both ambitious initiatives and significant challenges. The Cuban government has recognized the strategic importance of digital transformation and has launched several initiatives to modernize its economy and public services. The creation of the Artificial Intelligence Consortium, a collaboration between universities, state-owned technology companies, and private enterprises, signals a clear commitment to developing a sovereign AI ecosystem. This consortium aims to coordinate efforts in key sectors such as healthcare, education, transportation, and agriculture, developing AI solutions tailored to the Cuban context.

In healthcare, AI is being explored to optimize resource allocation, assist in medical diagnoses, and accelerate research. The country's robust biotech and pharmaceutical sectors are also beginning to leverage AI for innovation. In agriculture, AI applications are being developed to improve crop yields, manage irrigation, and detect diseases. These efforts are part of a broader national strategy to advance artificial intelligence across various sectors, as highlighted by the government's focus on science and innovation-based governance.

However, the path to AI adoption is not without its hurdles. Cuba faces significant infrastructural challenges, including limited internet connectivity, frequent power outages, and a lack of access to specialized hardware. These issues are compounded by the ongoing economic blockade, which restricts access to technology and financial resources. Furthermore, while Cuba possesses a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, there is a need to update academic programs and retain talent to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI.

On the regulatory front, Cuba has made some progress. The country has enacted a Personal Data Protection Law (Law 149/2022) and has updated its legal framework on telecommunications and cybersecurity. These regulations provide a starting point for AI governance, but a comprehensive framework specifically addressing the unique challenges and risks of AI is still lacking.

## The AI Governance Gap

Cuba is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This gap poses significant risks to the country's economic development, national security, and the well-being of its citizens. Without a clear regulatory framework, there is a risk of unchecked AI development and deployment, which could lead to a range of negative consequences, including algorithmic bias, job displacement, and the erosion of privacy. The absence of a national AI strategy also makes it difficult to attract foreign investment and participate in the global digital economy.

For Cuban businesses, the lack of a clear AI governance framework creates uncertainty and risk. Companies may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies without clear guidelines on data protection, liability, and ethical use. This can stifle innovation and put Cuban businesses at a competitive disadvantage. For citizens, the absence of a framework means that their rights and interests may not be adequately protected. There is a risk of their personal data being misused, or of being subjected to biased or unfair automated decisions.

## CSOAI's Solution for Cuba

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be customized to meet the specific needs and context of Cuba. Our solution is designed to be implemented quickly and efficiently, enabling Cuba to bridge the AI governance gap and align with international best practices. The framework is based on the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, a proven approach to managing and improving safety and quality.

At the core of our solution is the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, a decentralized AI oversight mechanism that ensures the robustness and resilience of AI systems. This innovative approach to AI governance is designed to prevent single points of failure and to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values.

To build local capacity and create a sustainable AI ecosystem, we offer the CEASAI (Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation) certification program. This program is designed to train a new generation of AI safety analysts in Cuba, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to implement and manage the AI Safety Framework. The CEASAI certification is a globally recognized credential that will open up new career opportunities for Cuban professionals.

## Implementation Roadmap

Our proposed implementation roadmap is designed to achieve full operational capability within 12 months:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** In this phase, we will work with Cuban stakeholders to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the country's current AI landscape, identify key priorities, and develop a customized implementation plan.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework, including the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, and integrate it with existing systems and processes.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** We will launch a nationwide training program to certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts through our CEASAI program.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** Within 12 months, Cuba will have a fully operational AI Safety Framework, a trained workforce of AI safety experts, and the capacity to manage and govern AI in a safe and ethical manner.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, the CSOAI is offering a £1 Billion Training Giveaway. Through this initiative, 500,250 individuals worldwide will receive free access to our CEASAI certification program. Cuban citizens are invited to take advantage of this opportunity to become certified AI safety professionals and to contribute to the development of a safe and prosperous digital future for their country.

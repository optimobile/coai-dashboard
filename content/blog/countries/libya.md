# AI Safety Framework for Libya: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Libya stands at a critical juncture. The recent launch of its first national AI model, LIBIGPT, signals a national commitment to embracing the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. However, this rapid technological advancement is occurring within a regulatory vacuum. With the European Union's AI Act set to take effect on February 2, 2026, the window for Libya to establish a robust AI safety and governance framework is closing. The Act's extraterritorial reach will inevitably impact Libyan businesses and organizations that interact with the EU market. Failure to align with international standards will not only stifle innovation and economic growth but also expose Libyan citizens and businesses to significant risks, including data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and a lack of legal recourse. Proactive adoption of a comprehensive AI safety framework is not merely a matter of compliance; it is a strategic imperative for Libya to harness the benefits of AI responsibly, build trust in its digital ecosystem, and secure its place in the global digital economy. The time for Libya to act is now.

## The Current State of AI in Libya

Libya's journey into the age of artificial intelligence is in its nascent stages, yet it is marked by a palpable sense of ambition and a growing recognition of AI's potential to drive national development. The recent unveiling of LIBIGPT, the nation's first large-scale generative AI model, represents a landmark achievement and a clear declaration of Libya's intent to become a participant, not just a spectator, in the global AI revolution. This initiative, driven by the private sector with governmental support, underscores a burgeoning ecosystem of tech entrepreneurs and researchers eager to leverage AI for economic diversification and societal progress.

Key industries are beginning to explore AI applications, albeit cautiously. The energy sector, the traditional backbone of the Libyan economy, is a prime candidate for AI-powered optimization, from predictive maintenance of oil and gas infrastructure to the analysis of seismic data for new discoveries. In the financial services sector, the Central Bank of Libya's forward-thinking establishment of data protection criteria for banks paves the way for the responsible adoption of AI in areas such as fraud detection, credit scoring, and personalized banking services. Furthermore, the public sector is witnessing a push towards digital transformation, with initiatives aimed at modernizing government services and improving administrative efficiency. The collaboration between the General Information Authority and the UNDP on a national human development report that incorporates digital transformation and AI is a testament to the government's commitment to data-driven policymaking.

However, this enthusiasm for AI is tempered by the reality of a legal and regulatory landscape that is still playing catch-up. While Libya has taken commendable steps to address cybercrime and electronic transactions through recent legislation, a comprehensive, AI-specific governance framework remains conspicuously absent. The existing legal provisions, including constitutional guarantees of privacy, offer a foundational layer of protection but lack the specificity and robustness required to address the complex challenges posed by AI. This regulatory gap, coupled with a still-developing digital infrastructure, presents both a significant hurdle and a unique opportunity for Libya to build a future-proof AI governance model from the ground up.

## The AI Governance Gap

Libya is one of 118 countries that have yet to establish a national AI strategy or governance framework. This gap places the nation in a precarious position, exposing it to a multitude of risks that could undermine its economic and social stability. Without a clear regulatory framework, there are no safeguards to prevent the misuse of AI, protect citizens from algorithmic bias, or ensure data privacy. This lack of oversight can lead to a host of problems, including the erosion of public trust in technology, the amplification of misinformation, and the potential for AI systems to be used for malicious purposes. For businesses, the absence of a clear legal framework creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and hinders their ability to compete in the global market. It also makes it difficult to attract foreign investment, as international partners are often hesitant to engage with countries that lack robust data protection and AI governance laws.

Furthermore, the impending EU AI Act, with its extraterritorial scope, will have a significant impact on Libyan businesses that offer goods or services to EU citizens. Non-compliance with the Act could result in hefty fines and restricted access to the lucrative EU market. The AI governance gap is not just a theoretical problem; it has real-world consequences for the people and businesses of Libya. It is a barrier to progress that must be addressed with urgency and foresight.

## CSOAI's Solution for Libya

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, turnkey solution to bridge Libya's AI governance gap and propel the nation into a future of safe and responsible AI. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy regulatory and technical infrastructure that can be customized to Libya's specific needs and cultural context. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable system that empowers Libya to build its own sovereign AI governance capability.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI Certification program, a globally recognized qualification for AI safety professionals. Through our £1 billion training giveaway, we are committed to training and certifying 1,000 Libyan AI Safety Analysts, creating an immediate and sustainable local capacity for AI oversight and risk management. These certified professionals will form the backbone of Libya's AI safety ecosystem, equipped with the skills and knowledge to assess, audit, and manage AI systems across all sectors.

To ensure robust and impartial AI governance, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight. This decentralized, multi-stakeholder body, composed of representatives from government, industry, academia, and civil society, will provide a resilient and tamper-proof mechanism for AI decision-making and incident response. The Council's distributed nature ensures that no single entity can exert undue influence, fostering a culture of transparency and accountability.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI safety management. This continuous improvement cycle enables organizations to proactively identify and mitigate AI risks, adapt to evolving threats, and ensure ongoing compliance with national and international standards. By adopting the CSOAI's comprehensive solution, Libya can not only meet the impending requirements of the EU AI Act but also establish itself as a regional leader in safe and ethical AI.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of a national AI safety framework in Libya, designed to deliver tangible results within a structured and realistic timeframe. This four-phase roadmap will guide Libya from its current state of AI infancy to full operational capability in AI governance.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The initial phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Libya's existing digital infrastructure, legal and regulatory landscape, and technical capabilities. Working in close collaboration with government ministries, industry stakeholders, and academic institutions, CSOAI will conduct a nationwide analysis to identify key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to AI adoption. This phase will culminate in the development of a detailed and customized AI Safety Framework, tailored to Libya's unique national context and strategic priorities.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

Following the approval of the customized framework, Phase 2 will focus on its nationwide deployment. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, the integration of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology into public and private sector organizations, and the launch of a public awareness campaign to educate citizens about the benefits and risks of AI. Technical assistance and capacity building will be provided to key government agencies to ensure a smooth and effective rollout of the new regulatory and technical infrastructure.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

Concurrent with Phase 2, CSOAI will launch its ambitious training program to certify 1,000 Libyan AI Safety Analysts through the CEASAI program. This intensive training will equip a new generation of Libyan professionals with the skills to audit, manage, and secure AI systems. The training will be delivered through a combination of online learning, in-person workshops, and hands-on projects, ensuring that graduates are not only theoretically knowledgeable but also practically adept.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

The final phase will mark the transition to full operational capability. The national AI safety framework will be fully embedded across all sectors, the Byzantine Council will be operational, and the newly certified AI Safety Analysts will be deployed in both the public and private sectors. This phase will also involve the establishment of a continuous monitoring and evaluation system to track the effectiveness of the framework, identify emerging risks, and make necessary adjustments to ensure that Libya remains at the forefront of safe and responsible AI.

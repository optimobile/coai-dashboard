# AI Safety Framework for Jordan: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Jordan, a nation at the forefront of digital transformation in the Middle East, is rapidly embracing the potential of Artificial Intelligence. With the third-highest AI adoption rate in the Arab world, the Kingdom is poised to leverage this technology for significant economic growth and societal advancement. However, this rapid progress also brings to light a critical governance gap. As the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, approaches, the need for a comprehensive AI safety framework in Jordan has become a pressing national priority. The absence of such a framework exposes the nation to risks including data privacy violations, algorithmic bias, and economic disadvantages. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) presents a timely and robust solution: a white-label, adaptable AI Safety Framework designed to empower Jordan to build a secure and prosperous digital future. This framework, combined with the CEASAI certification for local professionals and a clear implementation roadmap, offers Jordan a clear path to establishing itself as a regional leader in responsible AI innovation, ensuring that the benefits of AI are maximized while potential harms are effectively mitigated.

## The Current State of AI in Jordan

Jordan has firmly established itself as a key player in the Middle East's digital landscape, demonstrating a remarkable pace of AI adoption and integration. The nation's forward-thinking government, coupled with a young and tech-savvy population, has created a fertile ground for technological innovation. Jordan's commitment to digital transformation is evident in its national strategies and the rapid growth of its ICT sector, which currently accounts for 3% of the nation's GDP and is projected to grow exponentially in the coming years. This proactive approach has positioned Jordan as a regional leader, with an AI adoption rate that is third in the Arab world and 29th globally.

The drive to integrate AI is visible across various sectors of the Jordanian economy. While specific data on industry-wide adoption is still emerging, the government's clear intention to digitize key public services provides a strong indication of the direction of travel. The healthcare sector is a prime example, with a full digitization of public hospitals planned by the end of 2024. This initiative, along with similar efforts in finance, security, and agriculture, will undoubtedly be powered by AI-driven solutions. Furthermore, the Jordanian IT industry itself is a hotbed of AI innovation, with over 60% of IT companies already incorporating AI into their products and services, and a significant percentage actively looking to integrate data analysis tools and technologies.

Fueling this transformation are a series of ambitious government initiatives. The creation of the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship (MoDEE) in 2019 was a clear signal of the government's intent to move beyond traditional ICT and embrace a more holistic digital-first approach. This was further solidified by the launch of the National Digital Transformation Strategy & Implementation Plan (2021-2025) and the Economic Modernization Vision (2023-2025). These strategic frameworks provide a clear roadmap for the nation's digital future, with a strong emphasis on developing digital skills, enhancing digital infrastructure, and creating a supportive regulatory environment. The government's goal to digitize all governmental services by 2027 is a testament to its commitment to leveraging technology to improve the lives of its citizens.

However, this rapid technological advancement has also brought to the forefront the need for a robust legal and regulatory framework. While Jordan has made strides in this area with the enactment of the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) in March 2024 and the Cybersecurity Law in 2019, there remains a recognized need for more specific and comprehensive AI governance. The existing laws provide a solid foundation, but the unique challenges and opportunities presented by AI necessitate a dedicated and forward-looking regulatory approach. As Jordan continues on its path of digital transformation, the development of a comprehensive AI safety framework will be crucial to ensuring that this progress is both sustainable and beneficial for all.

## The AI Governance Gap

Jordan's impressive strides in AI adoption and digital transformation have positioned it as a regional leader. However, this rapid progress has also created a significant AI governance gap, placing Jordan among 118 countries that have yet to establish a comprehensive national AI strategy or framework. This gap is not merely a matter of policy; it represents a tangible risk to the nation's economic and social fabric. Without a clear and robust governance structure, Jordan faces the potential for uncontrolled AI development and deployment, which could lead to a host of negative consequences for both its citizens and businesses.

The risks associated with this governance vacuum are multifaceted. For citizens, the lack of regulation raises serious concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for AI-driven systems to make decisions that are unfair or discriminatory. In a world where AI is increasingly used in critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and justice, the absence of oversight can have profound and lasting impacts on individual lives. For businesses, the lack of a clear regulatory framework creates uncertainty and stifles innovation. Companies may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies without clear guidelines on what is and is not permissible, and they may also face challenges in competing with international firms that operate under more clearly defined regulatory regimes.

Furthermore, the absence of a national AI governance framework can have a significant impact on Jordan's international standing. As countries around the world, including the European Union with its landmark AI Act, move towards greater regulation of AI, Jordan risks being left behind. This could have a number of negative consequences, including a loss of competitiveness, a decline in foreign investment, and a diminished ability to participate in the global digital economy. In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to demonstrate a commitment to responsible AI development is not just a matter of good governance; it is a matter of economic survival.

## CSOAI's Solution for Jordan

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and adaptable solution to address Jordan's AI governance gap and empower the nation to build a secure and prosperous digital future. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy, customizable governance structure that can be tailored to Jordan's specific needs and priorities. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution; rather, it is a flexible and dynamic system that can evolve with the rapidly changing landscape of AI technology. It provides a clear set of guidelines and best practices for the development, deployment, and use of AI, ensuring that these technologies are aligned with Jordan's national values and priorities. The framework is designed to be implemented quickly and efficiently, enabling Jordan to establish a robust governance structure without the need for a lengthy and expensive development process.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI Certification program, a comprehensive training and certification program for local professionals. This program is designed to create a new generation of AI safety experts in Jordan, equipping them with the skills and knowledge they need to oversee the development and deployment of AI systems. The CEASAI certification is a globally recognized credential that will not only enhance the skills of Jordan's workforce but also attract foreign investment and create new economic opportunities. By building a strong local talent pool of AI safety experts, Jordan can ensure that it has the capacity to manage the risks associated with AI and to maximize the benefits of this transformative technology.

To ensure the effective implementation and oversight of the AI Safety Framework, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society, will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the framework and for making recommendations on how to adapt it to the changing needs of the country. The council's unique structure, based on the principles of Byzantine fault tolerance, will ensure that it is able to make decisions that are both robust and resilient, even in the face of uncertainty and disagreement. This decentralized and collaborative approach to governance will ensure that all voices are heard and that the framework is implemented in a way that is fair, transparent, and accountable.

Finally, our SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology provides a clear and practical framework for ensuring that AI systems are developed and deployed in a way that is compliant with the AI Safety Framework. This methodology, based on the well-established Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, provides a step-by-step guide for organizations to follow when developing and deploying AI systems. It includes a set of tools and templates that can be used to assess the risks associated with AI systems, to develop mitigation strategies, and to monitor the performance of these systems over time. The SOAI-PDCA methodology is a practical and effective tool that will help to ensure that AI is used in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all Jordanians.

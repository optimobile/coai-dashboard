# AI Safety Framework for Tonga: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Tonga stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence present a unique opportunity for the island nation to enhance its public services, boost its economy, and improve the lives of its citizens. However, with this opportunity comes a significant risk. The absence of a national AI safety and governance framework leaves Tonga vulnerable to the potential negative impacts of AI, including data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and economic disruption. The European Union's AI Act, with its fast-approaching February 2, 2026 deadline, will have extraterritorial effects, impacting how Tongan businesses and government agencies interact with the EU market. Proactive adoption of a robust AI safety framework is not just a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for Tonga to safeguard its digital future, build trust in AI systems, and unlock the full potential of this transformative technology for the benefit of all Tongans. This document outlines a clear roadmap for Tonga to build its AI governance today, ensuring a safe and prosperous AI-powered tomorrow.

## Current State of AI in Tonga

Tonga is embarking on a digital transformation journey, with Artificial Intelligence poised to play a pivotal role in the nation's development. While AI adoption is still in its nascent stages, the Tongan government has shown a clear commitment to leveraging technology for the betterment of its citizens. The launch of the TongaPass national digital ID system and a new e-government portal are foundational steps towards a more digitalized public sector. These initiatives, coupled with the development of localized AI tools like TongaGPT, signal a strategic move towards creating more accessible, efficient, and personalized government services for the people of Tonga.

The primary driver of AI adoption in Tonga is the public sector. The government is exploring AI applications to enhance service delivery, improve disaster management, and foster economic growth. For instance, the TongaGPT pilot aims to provide real-time, bilingual support to citizens interacting with the national portal, reducing administrative bottlenecks and improving citizen engagement. Furthermore, the use of AI in analyzing satellite imagery and climate data holds immense potential for strengthening Tonga's resilience to natural disasters, a critical concern for the island nation. Beyond the government, the tourism and agriculture sectors are also ripe for AI-powered innovation, from personalized travel experiences to precision farming techniques.

However, the full potential of AI in Tonga is yet to be unlocked. The country faces challenges such as limited internet penetration in rural areas and the need for a skilled workforce to develop and manage AI systems. While there are no specific AI regulations in place yet, the government's proactive approach to digital transformation provides a solid foundation for developing a comprehensive AI governance framework. Such a framework will be crucial for ensuring that AI is adopted in a safe, ethical, and inclusive manner, maximizing its benefits while mitigating potential risks. The journey of AI in Tonga has just begun, and with the right strategies and investments, the nation can harness the power of this transformative technology to build a more prosperous and resilient future.

## The AI Governance Gap

Tonga is not alone in its journey to navigate the complexities of Artificial Intelligence. A recent report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) highlighted that 118 countries, predominantly in the Global South, currently lack a dedicated AI governance framework. This AI governance gap places nations like Tonga in a precarious position, unable to fully harness the benefits of AI while being exposed to its potential risks. The absence of a strategic approach to AI governance can lead to a host of challenges, including the erosion of data privacy, the perpetuation of algorithmic bias, and a lack of accountability for AI-driven decisions. For citizens, this can translate into a loss of trust in both technology and government, while businesses may face uncertainty and a competitive disadvantage in the global market.

The risks of inaction are manifold. Without a clear regulatory framework, Tonga may become a testing ground for AI technologies that have not been adequately vetted for safety and ethical considerations. This could lead to the deployment of biased algorithms that exacerbate existing social inequalities or the misuse of personal data for commercial or political purposes. Furthermore, the lack of a national AI strategy can hinder innovation and investment, as businesses may be reluctant to operate in an environment of legal and regulatory uncertainty. As the world increasingly embraces AI, Tonga cannot afford to be left behind. Closing the AI governance gap is not just about mitigating risks; it is about proactively shaping a future where AI is a force for good, driving sustainable development and inclusive growth for all Tongans.

## CSOAI's Solution for Tonga

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to Tonga's unique cultural, economic, and social context. This is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a partnership to build a sustainable and effective AI governance ecosystem. The framework is designed to be implemented in phases, starting with a thorough assessment of Tonga's existing digital infrastructure, legal landscape, and workforce capabilities. This collaborative approach ensures that the resulting AI governance framework is not only compliant with international standards like the EU AI Act but also deeply rooted in Tongan values and priorities.

At the heart of the CSOAI's solution is the Certified AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program. This program is designed to empower Tongan citizens with the skills and knowledge to become certified AI safety experts. By training a local workforce of AI safety analysts, Tonga can build the internal capacity to manage and oversee the deployment of AI systems across the country. The CEASAI certification is a globally recognized qualification that will open up new career opportunities for Tongans and position the nation as a leader in AI safety in the Pacific region.

To ensure robust and impartial oversight of AI systems, the CSOAI proposes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders including government officials, industry experts, academics, and civil society representatives, will be responsible for reviewing and approving high-risk AI applications. The Byzantine Fault Tolerance model ensures that the council can reach a reliable consensus even if some of its members are unreliable or malicious, providing a strong safeguard against the misuse of AI.

Finally, the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a continuous improvement cycle for AI governance. This iterative process allows Tonga to adapt its AI safety framework as new technologies emerge and new challenges arise. The SOAI-PDCA methodology ensures that Tonga's AI governance remains agile, effective, and responsive to the evolving needs of its citizens and businesses. Together, these four pillars of the CSOAI's solution provide a clear and actionable roadmap for Tonga to build a world-class AI safety and governance framework.

## Implementation Roadmap

The successful deployment of a national AI Safety Framework in Tonga requires a phased and strategic approach. The following roadmap outlines a clear path for Tonga to achieve full operational capability within a 12-month timeframe:

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

This initial phase will focus on a comprehensive assessment of Tonga's current digital landscape. This includes a review of existing technology infrastructure, data governance policies, and legal frameworks. A series of workshops and consultations will be held with key stakeholders from government, industry, and civil society to gather insights and build consensus on the national AI vision. The key deliverable of this phase will be a detailed report outlining the findings of the assessment and a customized AI Safety Framework for Tonga.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

Building on the findings of the assessment phase, the second phase will focus on the deployment of the AI Safety Framework.

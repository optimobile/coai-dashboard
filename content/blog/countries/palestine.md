# AI Safety Framework for Palestine: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a comprehensive AI safety framework in Palestine has never been more urgent. The absence of a national strategy on artificial intelligence exposes Palestine to significant risks, including the misuse of AI, algorithmic bias, and a growing digital divide. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for fostering innovation, protecting citizens' rights, and ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared equitably across society. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this gap, providing a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a robust governance model. By adopting this framework now, Palestine can position itself as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the region, attract investment, and build a future-ready digital economy.

## Current State of AI in Palestine

Artificial intelligence adoption in Palestine is still in its nascent stages, but it holds immense potential to drive economic growth and social development. The Palestinian tech ecosystem, though small, is vibrant and growing, with a burgeoning startup scene and a young, tech-savvy population. Key industries are beginning to explore the applications of AI, particularly in sectors such as healthcare, education, and finance. For instance, AI-powered diagnostic tools are being piloted in some hospitals to improve healthcare outcomes, while educational platforms are leveraging AI to provide personalized learning experiences. In the financial sector, AI is being used for fraud detection and to enhance customer service.

The Palestinian Authority has recognized the importance of digital transformation and has launched several initiatives to modernize public services. The National Digital Strategy 2025-2030 aims to create a digital-first government, improve service delivery, and foster a knowledge-based economy. However, the strategy is still in its early stages of implementation, and there is a lack of a clear roadmap for AI adoption and governance. Existing technology regulations are limited and do not adequately address the unique challenges posed by AI. This regulatory gap, coupled with the ongoing political and economic challenges, hinders the widespread adoption of AI and exposes Palestine to the risks of unregulated AI development.

## The AI Governance Gap

Palestine is one of 118 countries that have yet to establish a national AI governance framework. This gap leaves the country vulnerable to a range of risks, including the erosion of privacy, the spread of misinformation, and the exacerbation of existing inequalities. Without a clear legal and ethical framework, there are no safeguards to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly. This lack of oversight can have a profound impact on citizens and businesses alike. For individuals, it can mean a loss of control over their personal data and exposure to biased or discriminatory algorithms. For businesses, it can create uncertainty and stifle innovation, as they navigate a complex and unregulated landscape.

The absence of a national AI strategy also puts Palestine at a competitive disadvantage in the global digital economy. As other countries race to embrace AI, Palestine risks being left behind. A robust AI governance framework is essential for building trust in AI systems, attracting foreign investment, and creating a level playing field for Palestinian businesses. It is not just about mitigating risks but also about seizing the opportunities that AI presents. By establishing clear rules of the road, Palestine can foster a thriving AI ecosystem that drives economic growth and improves the lives of its citizens.

## CSOAI's Solution for Palestine

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to the specific needs and context of Palestine. Our framework is designed to be a turnkey solution, providing a clear roadmap for AI governance and a set of practical tools for implementation. It is based on international best practices and is fully compliant with the EU AI Act and other emerging regulatory standards.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI Certification, a professional qualification for AI safety analysts. This program is designed to build local capacity and create a new generation of AI experts who can lead the implementation of the AI Safety Framework. The curriculum covers all aspects of AI governance, from technical standards and risk management to ethical considerations and public engagement.

To ensure robust oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This independent body would be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the AI Safety Framework, investigating incidents, and providing recommendations to the government. The council would be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including representatives from government, industry, academia, and civil society.

Our SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology provides a structured approach to AI governance, based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. This iterative process allows for continuous improvement and ensures that the AI Safety Framework remains relevant and effective in the face of rapid technological change. By adopting our solution, Palestine can not only meet its regulatory obligations but also build a world-class AI governance ecosystem that fosters innovation and protects the rights of its citizens.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a four-phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Palestine:

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

During this initial phase, we will work closely with the Palestinian Authority and other stakeholders to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current state of AI in Palestine. This will include a review of existing policies and regulations, an analysis of the local tech ecosystem, and a series of consultations with key stakeholders. Based on this assessment, we will develop a detailed implementation plan that is tailored to the specific needs and priorities of Palestine.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In this phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework and establish the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This will involve customizing the framework to the local context, developing the necessary legal and institutional arrangements, and providing training to the members of the council.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

This phase will focus on building local capacity through the CEASAI Certification program. We will work with local universities and training institutions to train 1,000 AI safety analysts who can lead the implementation of the framework across the public and private sectors.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

In the final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with the Byzantine Council providing ongoing oversight and the certified AI safety analysts driving compliance across the country. We will continue to provide support and guidance to ensure the long-term sustainability of the framework.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, we are offering a £1 billion training giveaway. This program provides free access to our CEASAI Certification for citizens of Palestine and other eligible countries. Our goal is to train 500,250 AI safety analysts worldwide, creating a global network of professionals who are dedicated to the responsible development and deployment of AI.

This initiative is designed to create immediate capacity and empower individuals with the skills they need to thrive in the digital economy. By providing free access to our world-class training program, we are not only helping to bridge the AI skills gap but also fostering a culture of safety and responsibility in the AI industry. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to participate in the AI revolution, and our training giveaway is a testament to that commitment.

# AI Safety Framework for Laos: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Laos stands at a critical juncture in its digital transformation journey. With the rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the nation has a unique opportunity to leapfrog legacy systems and build a future-proof digital economy. However, this opportunity is not without its risks. The European Union's AI Act, with its fast-approaching February 2, 2026 deadline, will have a global impact on AI governance and trade. For Laos to remain competitive and protect its citizens, the time to establish a robust AI safety framework is now. A proactive approach to AI governance will not only mitigate risks but also foster trust, attract investment, and ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a manner that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all Lao people. This is where the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) can play a pivotal role, offering a comprehensive, white-label solution to help Laos build its AI governance framework and create a new generation of AI safety professionals.

## Current State of AI in Laos

The artificial intelligence landscape in Laos has seen significant growth since 2023, with increasing adoption across multiple sectors including government, finance, telecommunications, and education. As of 2025, several key trends have emerged that define the current state of AI in the country. Government initiatives have played a crucial role in promoting AI adoption, with the National AI Strategy providing a framework for development and implementation of AI technologies across both public and private sectors. This has created a more structured approach to AI adoption, focusing on addressing local challenges and leveraging Laos' unique strengths. Financial services have emerged as early adopters of AI technology in Laos, with several major banks implementing chatbots, fraud detection systems, and automated credit scoring. These implementations have improved operational efficiency and customer service while reducing costs. The public sector has also seen significant AI integration, particularly in document processing and citizen services. Government departments are increasingly using optical character recognition (OCR) systems tailored for the Lao script to digitize paper documents and automate workflows. Educational institutions are incorporating AI literacy into their curricula, with several universities offering specialized courses in AI and machine learning. This focus on education is helping to build a pipeline of local talent that can support the growing AI ecosystem.

## The AI Governance Gap

Laos is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This 'governance gap' presents significant risks to the nation's economic and social fabric. Without clear regulations and oversight, the development and deployment of AI can lead to a host of problems, including algorithmic bias, job displacement, and the erosion of privacy. For citizens, the lack of an AI safety framework means they are vulnerable to the misuse of their data and the potential for discriminatory outcomes in areas such as employment and access to financial services. For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory environment creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and can lead to a lack of public trust. Furthermore, as international regulations like the EU AI Act come into force, Laotian businesses that are unable to demonstrate compliance with global standards will face significant barriers to trade and investment. The AI governance gap is not just a theoretical problem; it is a clear and present danger to Laos's digital future.

## CSOAI's Solution for Laos

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, turnkey solution to help Laos bridge the AI governance gap and build a world-class AI safety framework. Our white-label AI Safety Framework is a fully customizable solution that can be adapted to Laos's specific needs and cultural context. It provides a clear set of guidelines and best practices for the safe and ethical development and deployment of AI. To ensure that Laos has the local expertise to implement and manage this framework, we offer the CEASAI Certification program. This program is designed to train a new generation of AI Safety Analysts, providing them with the skills and knowledge they need to oversee the development and deployment of AI systems. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council provides a unique and robust mechanism for AI oversight. This decentralized approach to governance ensures that no single entity has control over the AI ecosystem, thereby reducing the risk of bias and corruption. Finally, our SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology provides a clear and structured approach to AI safety, based on the principles of Plan-Do-Check-Act. This methodology ensures that AI systems are continuously monitored and improved, and that any potential risks are identified and mitigated in a timely manner.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a four-phase implementation roadmap to help Laos build its AI safety framework and achieve full operational capability within 18 months.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

In this initial phase, we will work with the Laotian government and other stakeholders to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the country's current AI landscape. This will include a review of existing policies and regulations, an analysis of the country's digital infrastructure, and an assessment of the current state of AI adoption in key industries. Based on this assessment, we will develop a detailed implementation plan that is tailored to Laos's specific needs and priorities.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In this phase, we will deploy our white-label AI Safety Framework and work with the Laotian government to customize it to the country's specific needs. This will include the development of a national AI strategy, the establishment of a national AI regulatory body, and the development of a set of national AI standards.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

In this phase, we will launch a nationwide training program to train 1,000 AI Safety Analysts. This program will be delivered through a combination of online and in-person training, and will be open to all Laotian citizens.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

In this final phase, we will work with the Laotian government to ensure that the country's AI safety framework is fully operational. This will include the establishment of a national AI incident response team, the development of a national AI public awareness campaign, and the integration of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

CSOAI is committed to building a global community of AI safety professionals. As part of this commitment, we are giving away £1 billion in free CEASAI certification training to citizens of 118 countries, including Laos. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Laotian citizens to gain the skills and knowledge they need to become certified AI Safety Analysts. With 500,250 analysts being trained globally, this initiative will create a massive pool of talent that can help to ensure the safe and ethical development of AI around the world. By taking advantage of this free training, Laos can immediately build its capacity in AI safety and become a leader in the region.

## Call to Action

The time to act is now. Laos has a unique opportunity to build a world-class AI safety framework that will protect its citizens, foster innovation, and attract investment. We urge the Laotian government to partner with CSOAI to make this vision a reality.

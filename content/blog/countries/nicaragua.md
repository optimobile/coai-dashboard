# AI Safety Framework for Nicaragua: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Nicaragua stands at a critical juncture. The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a unique opportunity to accelerate economic growth and social development. However, without a robust governance framework, the country risks falling behind and exposing its citizens and businesses to significant risks. The European Union's AI Act, with its fast-approaching February 2, 2026 deadline, will have a global impact, setting a new standard for AI regulation. For Nicaraguan businesses to remain competitive and for the country to attract investment, aligning with these emerging international standards is not just an option, but a necessity. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be rapidly deployed in Nicaragua, enabling the nation to build a secure and prosperous digital future. This is a pivotal moment for Nicaragua to proactively shape its AI trajectory, ensuring that the development and deployment of AI are aligned with the nation's values and priorities.

## Current State of AI in Nicaragua

Nicaragua's engagement with Artificial Intelligence is still in its nascent stages, but the potential for growth is undeniable. AI adoption is primarily driven by the private sector, with key industries such as financial services, agriculture, and business process outsourcing beginning to explore AI-powered solutions to enhance efficiency and productivity. The e-commerce sector is also a promising area for AI application, with the potential to personalize customer experiences and optimize logistics. Academic institutions, notably the National University of Engineering (UNI), are playing a crucial role in fostering AI research and talent development. The Nicaraguan government has also taken steps towards digital transformation, with initiatives like the Broadband Program, supported by the Inter-American Development Bank, aimed at improving digital infrastructure. While there is no specific legislation for AI, new regulations in the fintech and telecommunications sectors are beginning to address critical issues like cybersecurity and data management, laying the groundwork for a more comprehensive AI governance framework.

## The AI Governance Gap

Nicaragua is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap poses significant risks to the nation's security, economy, and social fabric. Without clear regulations, there is a heightened risk of biased algorithms perpetuating social inequalities, a lack of accountability for AI-driven errors, and the potential for malicious use of AI technologies. For citizens, this could mean a loss of privacy, discriminatory practices, and a lack of recourse in the face of AI-related harm. For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory environment creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and could lead to a loss of trust from consumers and international partners. As the world moves towards greater AI regulation, Nicaraguan businesses may face trade barriers and a competitive disadvantage if they are unable to demonstrate compliance with international standards.

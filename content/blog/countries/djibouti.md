# AI Safety Framework for Djibouti: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Djibouti to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. The nation stands at a critical juncture, with the potential to harness artificial intelligence for significant economic growth and societal advancement. However, without a robust governance structure, Djibouti risks falling behind and exposing its citizens and businesses to the multifaceted risks of unregulated AI. This document outlines a strategic roadmap for Djibouti to not only meet the impending regulatory requirements but also to position itself as a leader in AI governance in the Horn of Africa. The proposed solution, offered by the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), is a white-label AI Safety Framework that includes the CEASAI Certification for local professionals, a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. This framework will empower Djibouti to build a resilient and ethical AI ecosystem, fostering innovation while ensuring the safety and security of its digital future.


## Current State of AI in Djibouti

Djibouti is at a nascent but promising stage of AI adoption, with the government actively pursuing a digital transformation agenda as part of its "Vision 2035" strategy. The nation's strategic location as a key trade and logistics hub in the Horn of Africa provides a fertile ground for AI-driven innovations, particularly in the ports and logistics sectors. The Djibouti Ports Corridor Road SA (DPCR SA) has already embarked on a groundbreaking initiative, the CorridorVision AI project, which utilizes the RapidCanvas AI platform to monitor road conditions and detect infrastructure issues in real-time. This project has reportedly resulted in a 30% reduction in maintenance costs and enhanced safety along the vital trade corridor connecting Djibouti's ports to Ethiopia.

Beyond logistics, the Djiboutian government has demonstrated a commitment to integrating AI into other critical sectors. In October 2025, a training program was launched for education inspectors to harness the power of artificial intelligence, signaling a move towards an AI-driven education revolution. The government is also in the process of developing a national AI strategy that will focus on smart agriculture, healthcare, and education, aiming to improve the living conditions of its citizens in a challenging environmental context. Furthermore, Djibouti is taking steps to modernize its digital infrastructure, including the development of a one-stop digital platform to streamline government-to-business services and the adoption of a new Digital Code in June 2025 to consolidate all regulations related to the digital sector.

While there is no specific legislation yet for AI, Djibouti has enacted a comprehensive data protection law as part of its Digital Code, which provides a foundation for ethical AI governance. The country's engagement with the African Union's Continental AI Strategy and its status as a signatory to the Malabo Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection further underscore its commitment to aligning with regional and international best practices. These initiatives, coupled with a growing fintech sector and the recent launch of a national e-wallet in partnership with Visa, indicate that Djibouti is laying the groundwork for a vibrant and responsible AI ecosystem.

## The AI Governance Gap

Djibouti, like many other nations, is currently navigating the complexities of the digital age without a dedicated national framework for AI governance. This places it among 118 countries that are yet to establish comprehensive regulations for artificial intelligence, creating a significant governance gap that could have far-reaching consequences. The absence of a clear legal and ethical framework for AI exposes Djibouti to a range of risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and the potential for AI systems to be used for malicious purposes. Without proper oversight, the deployment of AI technologies could inadvertently exacerbate existing social inequalities and undermine public trust in both government and the private sector.

For citizens, the lack of AI governance can translate into a lack of transparency and accountability. When AI systems are used to make critical decisions in areas such as healthcare, finance, and justice, individuals have a right to know how these decisions are made and to have recourse in case of errors or biases. Without a regulatory framework, there is no guarantee that these rights will be protected. Businesses also face uncertainty in the absence of clear AI regulations. The lack of a level playing field can stifle innovation, as companies may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies without knowing the legal and ethical boundaries. Furthermore, the absence of a national AI strategy can make it difficult for Djiboutian businesses to compete in the global market, where compliance with international standards such as the EU's AI Act is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for doing business.

The AI governance gap is not just a matter of legal compliance; it is a matter of national security and economic sovereignty. As AI technologies become more sophisticated, they have the potential to be used for a wide range of malicious activities, from cyberattacks to the spread of disinformation. A robust AI governance framework is essential to mitigate these risks and to ensure that AI is used in a way that is aligned with Djibouti's national interests. By taking proactive steps to close the AI governance gap, Djibouti can not only protect its citizens and businesses but also position itself as a responsible and forward-thinking leader in the digital age.

## CSOAI's Solution for Djibouti

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to address the specific needs and challenges of nations like Djibouti. This solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a customizable and scalable framework that can be adapted to the unique legal, cultural, and economic context of the country. The CSOAI framework is built on three core pillars: the CEASAI Certification, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. Together, these components provide a holistic solution for building a robust and resilient AI governance ecosystem.

The **CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts) Certification** is a professional certification program designed to create a new generation of AI safety experts. The program provides in-depth training on the technical, ethical, and legal aspects of AI safety, equipping individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to design, develop, and deploy safe and reliable AI systems. By offering this certification to local professionals in Djibouti, the CSOAI aims to build a local talent pool of AI safety analysts who can lead the country's AI governance efforts. This will not only create new job opportunities but also ensure that Djibouti has the in-house expertise to manage its AI ecosystem effectively.

The **33-Agent Byzantine Council** is a novel approach to AI oversight that is inspired by the principles of Byzantine fault tolerance. This decentralized and distributed governance model is composed of 33 specialized AI agents, each responsible for monitoring a specific aspect of the AI ecosystem. The agents work together to identify and mitigate risks, ensuring that AI systems are operating in a safe and ethical manner. The Byzantine Council is designed to be highly resilient and resistant to manipulation, providing a robust and trustworthy mechanism for AI oversight.

The **SOAI-PDCA (Safety of AI - Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** is a continuous improvement framework that helps organizations to systematically manage their AI risks. The PDCA cycle provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating AI risks, ensuring that organizations are in compliance with relevant regulations and best practices. The SOAI-PDCA methodology is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing organizations to tailor it to their specific needs and circumstances.

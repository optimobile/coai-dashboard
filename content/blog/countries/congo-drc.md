# AI Safety Framework for Congo (DRC): Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) stands at a pivotal moment in its technological evolution. With the rapid global advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the nation has a unique opportunity to harness this transformative technology to drive economic growth, improve public services, and create a prosperous future for its citizens. However, the unchecked adoption of AI also presents significant risks, including algorithmic bias, job displacement, and threats to privacy and security. As the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, approaches, the urgency for the DRC to establish a robust AI safety and governance framework has never been greater. Proactive implementation of such a framework will not only mitigate potential harms but also position the DRC as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the region, fostering innovation and attracting investment. This is a critical window for the DRC to build a future where AI serves the collective good of all its people, ensuring that technological progress aligns with ethical principles and societal values.

## Current State of AI in Congo (DRC)

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is in the early stages of a digital revolution, with the government actively pursuing a digital transformation agenda to modernize its economy and public services. The recently launched "National Digital Plan 2026–2030 (PNN2)" and the nation's first "National Artificial Intelligence Strategy" signal a strong commitment to embracing technology for national development [1]. This ambitious $1.5 billion plan aims to transform the DRC into a regional digital hub by 2030, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence, connectivity, and digital inclusion [2].

While AI adoption is still nascent, its potential is being explored in key sectors of the Congolese economy. In the vital mining sector, which is a cornerstone of the nation's economy, AI is being leveraged to optimize mineral exploration, improve efficiency, and combat illicit mining activities through satellite analysis [3]. The agricultural sector is also seeing the introduction of AI-powered solutions to enhance productivity and food security, with programs focused on improving data integration and sharing among government entities and private agri-techs [4]. In healthcare, AI is being deployed to bridge healthcare gaps, particularly in the diagnosis and management of diseases like tuberculosis, through portable X-ray systems and AI-powered diagnostic tools [5].

The Congolese government's digital transformation initiatives extend beyond these sectors. Efforts are underway to digitize civil registration and establish a national digital ID system, which will provide a foundation for more advanced digital services [2]. Furthermore, the government has enacted Law No. 23/010 of March 13, 2023, establishing a digital code that provides a legal framework for digital activities, including data protection and electronic transactions [6]. This demonstrates a growing awareness of the need for a regulatory environment that can support a burgeoning digital economy.

Despite these positive developments, the DRC faces significant challenges in its AI journey. The country's low ranking on the AI Government Readiness Index highlights the need for substantial investment in infrastructure, human capital, and a more comprehensive regulatory framework [7]. The successful implementation of the national AI strategy and the establishment of the Congolese AI Academy will be crucial in addressing these challenges and unlocking the full potential of AI for the DRC's future.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its ambitious digital transformation agenda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is currently one of the 118 countries worldwide that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This gap exists primarily because the nation's focus has been on foundational digital infrastructure and connectivity, with a dedicated national AI strategy only recently being formulated. While the development of a digital code is a positive step, it does not provide the comprehensive, nuanced oversight required for the complexities of artificial intelligence. This legislative and regulatory vacuum leaves the nation, its citizens, and its businesses vulnerable to a host of risks.

The absence of a robust AI governance framework exposes the DRC to significant dangers. Without clear ethical guidelines and standards, the deployment of AI systems could perpetuate and even amplify existing societal biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas such as loan applications, hiring processes, and even criminal justice. There are also substantial risks to privacy and data security, as the vast amounts of data required to train AI models could be misused or fall into the wrong hands. Furthermore, the lack of a clear legal framework for AI-related incidents could lead to a chaotic environment where accountability is difficult to establish, eroding public trust in both technology and government.

For the citizens of the DRC, the impact of this governance gap is profound. Their fundamental rights to privacy, fairness, and due process are at risk. The digital divide could also widen, with the benefits of AI accruing to a select few while the majority of the population is left behind. For businesses, the lack of a clear and predictable regulatory environment creates uncertainty, stifling innovation and deterring investment. Congolese companies may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace, unable to meet the increasingly stringent AI governance standards required by international partners and customers. To truly unlock the potential of AI for all, the DRC must move swiftly to close this governance gap and build a framework that fosters trust, accountability, and inclusive growth.


## CSOAI's Solution for Congo (DRC)

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, turnkey solution designed to address the AI governance gap in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and empower the nation to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI ecosystem. Our approach is not merely about compliance; it is about building a sustainable, long-term capability for AI safety and governance that is tailored to the specific needs and context of the DRC.

At the heart of our solution is a **White-label AI Safety Framework**. This is a customizable, ready-to-deploy framework that can be adapted to the DRC's unique legal, cultural, and economic landscape. Rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we work with national stakeholders to co-design a framework that aligns with the DRC's values and development priorities. This framework provides clear guidelines for the ethical development, deployment, and use of AI, covering areas such as data privacy, algorithmic transparency, and accountability. By adopting this white-label framework, the DRC can rapidly establish a robust governance regime, saving years of development time and resources.

To ensure that the DRC has the human capital to implement and manage this framework, we offer the **CEASAI Certification** for local professionals. The Council of European AI Safety Analysts (CEASAI) has developed a world-class training and certification program that equips individuals with the skills and knowledge to become certified AI Safety Analysts. This program, which will be made available to Congolese citizens, will create a new generation of experts who can lead the nation's AI safety efforts. These certified professionals will be at the forefront of auditing AI systems, advising businesses and government agencies, and ensuring that AI is used responsibly and ethically.

For robust oversight and to ensure the integrity of the AI ecosystem, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**. This innovative governance model is inspired by the principles of Byzantine fault tolerance, a concept from computer science that ensures the reliability of a system even when some of its components fail. The council would be composed of 33 independent, diverse stakeholders, including representatives from government, industry, academia, civil society, and the public. This decentralized and resilient oversight body would be responsible for monitoring the AI landscape, investigating incidents, and making recommendations to policymakers. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council would provide a powerful mechanism for ensuring that AI is governed in the public interest, with checks and balances to prevent any single entity from having undue influence.

Finally, to operationalize the AI safety framework, we introduce the **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology**. This is a continuous improvement cycle based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) model, a proven management method for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products. The SOAI-PDCA methodology provides a structured approach for organizations to assess their AI systems, identify and mitigate risks, and continuously improve their AI safety and governance practices. This practical, hands-on approach will enable Congolese businesses and government agencies to build a culture of responsibility and to demonstrate their commitment to safe and ethical AI.

By combining a customizable framework, a world-class certification program, an innovative oversight body, and a practical compliance methodology, CSOAI offers the DRC a comprehensive and effective solution to the AI governance challenge. Our approach is designed to empower the DRC to not only meet the requirements of the EU AI Act but also to become a leader in responsible AI adoption in Africa, creating a future where AI drives progress and prosperity for all.


## Implementation Roadmap

To ensure a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance, the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) proposes a phased implementation roadmap for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This roadmap is designed to be both ambitious and achievable, with clear milestones and timelines to guide the process.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase of our engagement will focus on a comprehensive assessment of the DRC's current digital landscape. We will work closely with government ministries, regulatory bodies, industry leaders, and academic institutions to understand the nation's specific needs, challenges, and opportunities. This will involve a thorough review of existing legislation, an analysis of the current state of AI adoption, and a mapping of key stakeholders. Based on this assessment, we will develop a detailed and customized implementation plan, including the adaptation of our white-label AI Safety Framework to the DRC's unique context. This collaborative planning process will ensure that the framework is not only robust and effective but also enjoys broad-based support from all sectors of society.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

With a solid plan in place, the second phase will focus on the deployment of the AI Safety Framework. This will involve the formal adoption of the framework by the Congolese government and the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. We will provide technical assistance and capacity building to support the operationalization of the framework, including the development of regulatory tools, guidelines, and best practices. During this phase, we will also launch a nationwide awareness campaign to educate the public and businesses about the new AI governance regime and its importance for the nation's future.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

In parallel with the framework deployment, we will launch an intensive training program to create a critical mass of AI Safety Analysts in the DRC. Through our CEASAI certification program, we will train and certify at least 1,000 Congolese professionals in the first year. This will create a vibrant and skilled workforce that can support the implementation of the AI Safety Framework, provide expert advice to businesses and government agencies, and drive innovation in the field of AI safety. This new cadre of professionals will be the backbone of the DRC's AI governance ecosystem.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

Within a year of commencing the program, the DRC will have achieved full operational capability in AI safety and governance. The AI Safety Framework will be fully implemented, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council will be operational, and a new generation of AI Safety Analysts will be actively working to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI across the country. The SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology will be widely adopted by businesses and government agencies, fostering a culture of continuous improvement in AI safety. At this point, the DRC will not only be compliant with international standards such as the EU AI Act but will also be a regional leader in responsible AI adoption, attracting investment and creating a prosperous and inclusive digital future for its citizens.

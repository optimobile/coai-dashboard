# AI Safety Framework for Madagascar: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Madagascar stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence present a historic opportunity for national development, but they also bring significant risks. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Madagascar to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework is now. The nation is currently one of 118 countries without a national AI strategy, creating a governance gap that leaves its citizens, businesses, and national interests vulnerable. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to ensure that AI is adopted in a safe, ethical, and beneficial manner. This document outlines a clear and actionable roadmap for Madagascar to not only meet the impending international standards but also to leverage AI as a powerful engine for sustainable and inclusive growth. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this gap, providing a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a proven methodology to build a robust and resilient AI ecosystem in Madagascar.

## The Current State of AI in Madagascar

Madagascar's journey into the age of artificial intelligence is just beginning, but the nation is showing promising signs of embracing this transformative technology. While AI adoption is still in its nascent stages, there is a palpable sense of momentum, driven by a combination of government foresight, private sector ingenuity, and a growing pool of tech-savvy talent. The digital economy is gaining traction, and with it, the potential for AI to unlock unprecedented opportunities for growth and development.

The Malagasy government has demonstrated a clear commitment to digital transformation through its **National Digital Strategy 2023-2028 (PSN)**. This ambitious plan is focused on developing the telecommunications sector and digitizing public services, laying a crucial foundation for the widespread adoption of AI. A key component of this strategy is the **Digital Governance and Identification Management System Project (PRODIGY)**, a large-scale initiative aimed at modernizing the country's digital infrastructure and identity management systems. These government-led efforts are creating a more favorable environment for AI to flourish, with the potential to enhance public administration, improve service delivery, and foster greater transparency and efficiency.

In the private sector, several key industries are beginning to explore the potential of AI to drive innovation and competitiveness. The **telecommunications sector**, a cornerstone of the digital economy, is a natural frontrunner in AI adoption. Other sectors, such as **agriculture, logistics, and financial services**, are also showing a growing interest in AI-powered solutions. For instance, AI is being used to improve crop yields, optimize supply chains, and expand access to financial services for underserved populations. The use of AI in **customs**, with tools for image analysis and risk assessment, has already led to a significant increase in revenue collection, demonstrating the tangible benefits of this technology.

Despite this progress, Madagascar's regulatory landscape for technology is still evolving. The country has a data protection law, **Law No. 2014-038**, but its implementation has been limited. As for AI-specific regulations, Madagascar is in the very early stages of developing a framework. This presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The absence of a clear regulatory framework can create uncertainty and hinder investment, but it also provides a unique chance to design a forward-looking governance structure that is tailored to Madagascar's specific needs and priorities. By taking a proactive approach to AI governance, Madagascar can ensure that this powerful technology is harnessed in a way that is both innovative and responsible, driving sustainable development while safeguarding the rights and interests of its citizens.

## The AI Governance Gap

Madagascar, like many other nations, finds itself in a precarious position in the rapidly evolving global AI landscape. The country is one of 118 nations that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This AI governance gap is not merely a matter of lagging behind in policy-making; it represents a significant and growing risk to the nation's economic and social fabric. Without a clear and robust framework to guide the development and deployment of AI, Madagascar is left vulnerable to a host of challenges that could undermine its development goals and compromise the well-being of its citizens.

The absence of a national AI strategy creates a vacuum that can be filled by a fragmented and uncoordinated approach to AI adoption. This can lead to a host of problems, including the proliferation of biased algorithms, the erosion of privacy, and the exacerbation of existing inequalities. For businesses, the lack of a clear regulatory framework creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and hinders their ability to compete in the global marketplace. Without clear rules of the road, companies may be hesitant to invest in AI, and those that do may face legal and reputational risks.

For citizens, the stakes are even higher. The unchecked use of AI can have a profound impact on their daily lives, from the way they access information and services to the way they are treated by the justice system. Without proper safeguards, AI could be used to spread misinformation, discriminate against certain groups, and undermine democratic processes. The potential for harm is particularly acute in a country like Madagascar, where digital literacy is still developing and many people may not be aware of the risks associated with AI.

The impending deadline of the EU AI Act in February 2026 adds another layer of urgency to this issue. The Act, which will have extraterritorial reach, will set a new global standard for AI governance. Countries that fail to align with these standards may find themselves at a significant disadvantage, facing barriers to trade and investment. For Madagascar, which has strong economic ties with Europe, the failure to adopt a comprehensive AI safety framework could have serious economic consequences. By taking a proactive approach to AI governance, Madagascar can not only mitigate these risks but also position itself as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the region.

## CSOAI's Solution for Madagascar

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and tailored solution to help Madagascar bridge the AI governance gap and build a thriving and responsible AI ecosystem. Our approach is not about imposing a one-size-fits-all model, but rather about empowering Madagascar with the tools, knowledge, and expertise it needs to chart its own course in the age of AI. Our solution is built on four key pillars:

**1. White-label AI Safety Framework:**

CSOAI provides a ready-to-use, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be quickly and easily adapted to Madagascar's specific needs and priorities. This framework is not a rigid set of rules, but a flexible and adaptable system that can evolve as the AI landscape changes. It provides a clear and comprehensive set of guidelines for the responsible development, deployment, and use of AI, covering everything from data privacy and security to algorithmic fairness and transparency. By adopting this framework, Madagascar can quickly establish a robust governance structure that is aligned with international best practices, including the EU AI Act.

**2. CEASAI Certification for Local Professionals:**

Building a sustainable AI ecosystem requires a skilled and knowledgeable workforce. That's why CSOAI has established the Council of European AI Safety Analysts International (CEASAI), a professional certification program designed to train and accredit AI safety analysts. Through our partnership with CEASAI, we can help Madagascar build a local pool of certified AI safety experts who can provide the expertise and guidance needed to implement and oversee the national AI safety framework. This will not only create new job opportunities for Malagasy citizens but also ensure that the country has the in-house capacity to manage its own AI future.

**3. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:**

To ensure the ongoing safety and reliability of AI systems, CSOAI has developed a unique and innovative oversight mechanism known as the 33-Agent Byzantine Council. This council is a decentralized network of 33 specialized AI agents that work together to monitor and assess the performance of AI systems in real-time. By using a Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm, the council can ensure that AI systems are operating as intended, even in the presence of malicious actors or unforeseen circumstances. This provides an unprecedented level of assurance and helps to build trust in AI.

**4. SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:**

To ensure that AI systems are not only safe but also effective, CSOAI has developed the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology. This is a continuous improvement framework that helps organizations to systematically assess and improve the performance of their AI systems. By following this methodology, organizations can ensure that their AI systems are aligned with their business goals, are meeting the needs of their customers, and are complying with all relevant regulations. This helps to create a culture of continuous improvement and ensures that AI is used in a way that delivers real and lasting value.

By leveraging these four pillars, Madagascar can quickly and effectively build a world-class AI governance framework that will not only protect its citizens and businesses but also position the country as a leader in responsible AI adoption in Africa and beyond.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a clear and actionable roadmap to guide Madagascar through the process of implementing its national AI safety framework. This roadmap is divided into four distinct phases, each with its own set of deliverables and timelines. This phased approach ensures that the implementation process is manageable, efficient, and effective.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase of the implementation process is focused on conducting a comprehensive assessment of Madagascar's current AI landscape. This includes identifying key stakeholders, assessing the existing legal and regulatory framework, and understanding the specific needs and priorities of the country. Based on this assessment, we will work with the Malagasy government to develop a detailed implementation plan that is tailored to the country's unique circumstances.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

Once the implementation plan is in place, the next phase is to deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework. This involves customizing the framework to meet Madagascar's specific requirements, integrating it with existing systems and processes, and providing training to key personnel. This phase will be conducted in close collaboration with local partners to ensure that the framework is implemented in a way that is both effective and sustainable.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

The third phase of the implementation process is focused on building local capacity by training a new generation of AI safety analysts. Through our partnership with CEASAI, we will provide comprehensive training and certification to 1,000 Malagasy citizens, equipping them with the skills and knowledge they need to oversee the national AI safety framework. This will not only create new job opportunities but also ensure that Madagascar has the in-house expertise to manage its own AI future.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

The final phase of the implementation process is to achieve full operational capability. This means that the national AI safety framework is fully implemented, the local workforce is fully trained, and the country has the capacity to manage its own AI ecosystem in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner. At this stage, Madagascar will be well-positioned to leverage the full potential of AI to drive sustainable and inclusive growth.

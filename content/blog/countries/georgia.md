# AI Safety Framework for Georgia: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Georgia to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework is now. As a nation rapidly emerging as a technology and innovation hub, Georgia stands at a critical juncture. The proactive adoption of a robust governance structure will not only ensure compliance with international standards but also solidify its position as a leader in ethical and responsible AI. A national AI safety framework will empower Georgian businesses to compete on the global stage, attract further investment, and build trust with citizens by safeguarding their rights and privacy. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to accelerate this process, providing Georgia with the tools, training, and expertise needed to navigate the complexities of AI governance and unlock the full potential of this transformative technology.

## The Current State of AI in Georgia: A Nation on the Brink of an AI Revolution

Georgia is no longer a silent player in the global technology landscape; it is a dynamic and rapidly growing hub for innovation, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence. The state's forward-thinking economic policies, coupled with a rich pool of diverse talent and world-class academic institutions, have created a fertile ground for technological advancement. With over 14,000 technology companies contributing to a $50 billion economic impact, the state is poised for an AI-driven transformation. An estimated 100,000 new tech jobs are expected by 2033, with AI being the primary catalyst for this growth.

Key industries in Georgia are already harnessing the power of AI to drive efficiency and innovation. The financial technology (Fintech) sector is a prime example, with an astonishing 70% of all U.S. transactions being processed by firms based in Georgia. In cybersecurity, the state is a top-10 player, with over 120 companies generating $4.7 billion in annual revenue. The manufacturing sector is also undergoing a significant AI-powered evolution, supported by initiatives like the Georgia AI in Manufacturing (GA-AIM) project. Furthermore, AI is making significant inroads in healthcare, transportation, and supply chain management, optimizing processes and improving services across the board.

The Georgian government has been a key enabler of this digital transformation. The Georgia Technology Authority (GTA), through its Office of Artificial Intelligence, is championing the cause of "responsible AI governance." This commitment is demonstrated through the establishment of the Horizons Innovation Lab, a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to fostering AI projects and collaboration. The government has also been proactive in developing an official AI policy and providing guidance on the ethical use of AI tools. Recognizing the importance of human capital, the state is actively promoting AI training and literacy programs to equip its workforce with the skills needed for the future.

While Georgia has made significant strides in fostering a pro-innovation environment, the regulatory landscape for AI is still in its nascent stages. The current approach is one of collaboration, with lawmakers working closely with industry leaders and academic experts to craft a balanced regulatory framework. The goal is to encourage innovation while mitigating potential risks, a strategy championed by organizations like the Technology Association of Georgia (TAG). However, as the EU AI Act deadline approaches, the need for a more formalized and comprehensive governance structure becomes increasingly urgent. The absence of a clear regulatory framework could hinder Georgia's ability to fully capitalize on its AI potential and expose its citizens and businesses to unnecessary risks.

## The AI Governance Gap: A Call for Proactive Regulation

Georgia's rapid ascent as a technology hub has been remarkable, but it has also created a significant governance gap. The country is one of 118 nations that currently lack a formal, comprehensive AI governance framework. This absence of regulation, while fostering a permissive environment for innovation, also exposes Georgia to a range of risks that could undermine its long-term technological and economic ambitions. Without a clear set of rules and standards, the development and deployment of AI technologies can proceed unchecked, potentially leading to a host of negative consequences for both citizens and businesses.

The most immediate risk is the potential for misalignment with international standards, particularly the EU's AI Act. As the February 2, 2026, deadline for compliance looms, Georgian companies that operate in or with the European Union will face significant legal and financial penalties if they fail to meet the Act's stringent requirements. This could severely hamper their ability to compete in the global market and limit their access to one of the world's largest economies. Furthermore, the lack of a national AI governance framework can erode public trust. Citizens may become wary of AI technologies if they feel their privacy, security, and fundamental rights are not being protected. This could lead to a public backlash against AI, slowing down its adoption and limiting its potential benefits.

For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory framework creates uncertainty and unpredictability. Companies may be hesitant to invest in AI if they are unsure about the legal and ethical landscape. This can stifle innovation and put Georgian businesses at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, without a proper governance structure, there is a higher risk of AI systems being used for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation, perpetrating fraud, or discriminating against certain groups of people. These risks are not merely theoretical; they are real-world challenges that countries around the world are grappling with. By failing to address the AI governance gap, Georgia is leaving itself vulnerable to these threats.

## CSOAI's Solution for Georgia: A Comprehensive Framework for a Secure AI Future

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label solution designed to help Georgia bridge its AI governance gap and establish a secure and prosperous AI-powered future. Our framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a customizable and adaptable solution that can be tailored to meet the specific needs and priorities of the Georgian government, its industries, and its citizens. Our goal is to empower Georgia to become a leader in responsible AI, fostering innovation while ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of its people.

At the core of our solution is the **White-label AI Safety Framework**, a ready-to-deploy governance structure that can be customized to align with Georgia's legal and cultural context. This framework provides a clear set of rules and guidelines for the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies, ensuring that they are aligned with ethical principles and international best practices. It covers a wide range of issues, from data privacy and security to algorithmic transparency and accountability. By adopting this framework, Georgia can quickly establish a robust and future-proof AI governance regime.

To ensure that Georgia has the local expertise to implement and manage this framework, we offer the **CEASAI Certification** program. This program is designed to train and certify a new generation of AI safety analysts, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to assess the risks and opportunities of AI technologies. Our goal is to train 1,000 AI safety analysts in Georgia, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of local talent that can drive the country's AI ambitions forward.

To provide ongoing oversight and guidance, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight**. This council, composed of a diverse group of experts from government, industry, academia, and civil society, will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the AI safety framework, providing advice on emerging AI issues, and ensuring that Georgia's AI governance regime remains up-to-date and effective.

Finally, our **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** provides a structured and systematic approach to AI governance. This methodology helps organizations to plan their AI initiatives, implement them in a responsible manner, monitor their performance, and continuously improve their AI governance practices. By adopting this methodology, Georgian businesses can ensure that they are not only compliant with national and international regulations but also at the forefront of responsible AI innovation.

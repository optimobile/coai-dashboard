# AI Safety Framework for Costa Rica: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the EU AI Act's February 2, 2026, deadline fast approaching, Costa Rica stands at a critical juncture. The nation's rapid advancements in AI adoption and its forward-thinking national strategy are commendable, but the absence of a comprehensive AI governance framework presents a significant risk. This gap not only exposes citizens and businesses to potential harm but also threatens to undermine Costa Rica's ambition to become a regional AI leader. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a timely and comprehensive solution. Our white-label AI Safety Framework, coupled with the CEASAI certification program and the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, provides a clear and actionable roadmap for Costa Rica to establish a world-class AI governance regime. By embracing this opportunity, Costa Rica can not only mitigate the risks of ungoverned AI but also solidify its position as a global benchmark for responsible innovation. This is a pivotal moment for Costa Rica to build tomorrow's AI governance today, ensuring a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI future for all its citizens.

## Current State of AI in Costa Rica

Costa Rica is rapidly emerging as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) adoption and development within Latin America. The nation's commitment to technological advancement, coupled with a strategic vision for ethical AI implementation, has positioned it as a hub for innovation in the region. A confluence of factors, including a highly skilled workforce, a favorable business climate, and proactive government initiatives, is driving this transformation. The country's digital transformation has been accelerated by both opportunities and challenges, including a significant cyberattack that highlighted the critical need for digital resilience.

Key industries in Costa Rica are increasingly leveraging AI to enhance productivity and innovation. According to the Costa Rican Coalition of Development Initiatives (CINDE), 75% of multinational service companies in the country are implementing AI-based technologies, with 34% planning further investment. The financial sector, in particular, is exploring AI for applications such as fraud detection, credit scoring, and personalized banking services. The technology sector, with the presence of major companies like Intel and Amazon, is another significant driver of AI adoption. Furthermore, about 50% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Costa Rica are now using AI tools in their daily operations, indicating a broad-based adoption across the economy.

The Costa Rican government has been a key enabler of this digital transformation. In August 2023, the government launched the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (ENIA) 2024-2027, the first of its kind in Central America. This strategy, developed in partnership with UNESCO, emphasizes the ethical, inclusive, and responsible use of AI for the benefit of citizens. The ENIA outlines a roadmap for building capacity, promoting research and development, and establishing a governance framework for AI. This forward-looking approach has been recognized by the OECD, which has indexed Costa Rica's progress in its international AI policy dashboard.

While Costa Rica has made significant strides in AI, it also faces challenges. The country's AI boom is constrained by a lack of critical computing infrastructure needed to support autonomous development and a data-driven economy. Although there are several legislative proposals, a formal regulatory framework for AI is yet to be established, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors. The existing data protection law, Law No. 8968 on the Protection of the Person against the Processing of their Personal Data, is currently under review with Bill No. 23097, which aims to align it with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This modernization of privacy rules is a crucial step towards building a trustworthy AI ecosystem in the country.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its forward-thinking approach to AI adoption and the development of a national strategy, Costa Rica is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This gap between ambition and regulation creates a precarious situation for the nation, its citizens, and its businesses. The absence of a formal, legally binding framework for AI governance means that the development and deployment of AI technologies are proceeding without the necessary guardrails to ensure safety, accountability, and ethical use. This exposes the country to a range of risks, from the erosion of public trust to the potential for significant economic and social disruption.

The risks of this governance gap are multifaceted. For citizens, the lack of regulation can lead to violations of privacy, algorithmic bias that perpetuates and amplifies existing inequalities, and a lack of transparency in how their data is being used. Without a clear legal framework, there is little recourse for individuals who are harmed by AI systems, whether through discriminatory loan applications, unfair hiring practices, or the spread of misinformation. The absence of a robust governance framework also undermines the potential for AI to be a force for social good, as the public may become increasingly wary of technologies that are not subject to meaningful oversight.

For businesses, the AI governance gap creates a climate of uncertainty that can stifle innovation and investment. Companies that are developing or using AI are operating in a legal gray area, unsure of their rights and responsibilities. This can make it difficult to attract investment, enter into partnerships, and scale their operations. Moreover, as international regulations such as the EU AI Act come into force, Costa Rican businesses that are not compliant with these standards may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage, unable to access global markets. The lack of a clear regulatory framework also makes it challenging for businesses to build trust with their customers, who are increasingly demanding transparency and accountability in how their data is used.

## CSOAI's Solution for Costa Rica

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, turnkey solution to address Costa Rica's AI governance gap and accelerate the nation's journey towards becoming a responsible AI leader. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy governance structure that can be customized to meet Costa Rica's specific needs and cultural context. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a flexible and adaptable set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be integrated with Costa Rica's existing legal and regulatory landscape. It is designed to be fully operational within a short timeframe, enabling the government to establish a robust AI governance regime without the need for a lengthy and resource-intensive development process.

At the heart of our solution is the Certified Expert in AI Safety and Audit (CEASAI) program, a professional certification designed to build local capacity in AI safety and governance. Through our £1 billion global training giveaway, Costa Rican citizens can access this world-class training for free, creating a pipeline of skilled AI safety analysts who can support the implementation and ongoing management of the national AI framework. The CEASAI certification program is designed to equip professionals with the knowledge and skills they need to conduct AI risk assessments, perform algorithmic audits, and ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner.

To ensure robust and independent oversight of the AI ecosystem, the CSOAI proposes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society, would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the AI Safety Framework, providing guidance on emerging AI-related issues, and ensuring that the development and use of AI in Costa Rica aligns with the nation's values and priorities. The Byzantine fault-tolerant structure of the council is designed to ensure its resilience and integrity, even in the face of disagreement or malicious actors.

To operationalize the AI Safety Framework, the CSOAI has developed the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology. This iterative, risk-based approach to AI governance enables organizations to continuously assess and improve their AI systems, ensuring that they remain safe, effective, and compliant with evolving regulations and best practices. The SOAI-PDCA methodology provides a structured and systematic approach to AI governance, enabling organizations to identify and mitigate AI-related risks, demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements, and build trust with their customers and stakeholders.

# AI Safety Framework for Liberia: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

_**Executive Summary**_

Liberia stands at a critical juncture. The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity for national development, but it also carries significant risks. With the European Union's AI Act set to take effect on February 2, 2026, the need for a comprehensive AI safety framework in Liberia has become urgent. This legislation will have a global impact, influencing international trade and data flows. Without a robust governance structure, Liberia risks being left behind in the digital economy, unable to fully harness the benefits of AI while remaining vulnerable to its potential harms. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a proactive solution: a white-label AI Safety Framework designed to be adapted to Liberia's specific needs. By establishing a clear regulatory environment, promoting ethical AI development, and building local capacity through training and certification, Liberia can create a vibrant and responsible AI ecosystem. This will not only attract investment and foster innovation but also ensure that AI is used to empower citizens, improve public services, and drive sustainable economic growth. The time to act is now. By embracing a proactive approach to AI governance, Liberia can build a future where technology serves the interests of all its people.

## The Current State of AI in Liberia

Liberia is currently navigating the initial stages of AI adoption, with a growing recognition of its potential to accelerate national development. The country's digital landscape is characterized by a mix of foundational initiatives and emerging innovations. The government, in partnership with international organizations, is actively working to build a digital economy and bridge the technological gap. A key example of this is the **Liberia Digital Transformation Project (LDTP)**, a government-led initiative aimed at modernizing digital infrastructure, promoting digital literacy, and providing support for technology startups [1].

Recent developments highlight Liberia's commitment to embracing AI. In late 2025, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) launched an **AI Sprint training program** in Liberia, which trained approximately 70 government officials on the fundamentals of AI [2]. This program focused on the government's role as a regulator, user, and enabler of AI, laying the groundwork for a national AI strategy. Furthermore, the UNDP has partnered with the University of Liberia to establish the country's first **Master of Applied AI (MAI) program**, a landmark initiative that will cultivate a new generation of AI professionals in the country [3].

In terms of practical applications, Liberia has already taken a significant step forward with the launch of the **Instant Inclusive Payment System (IIPS)**, an AI-supported digital payment platform [4]. This system is designed to enhance financial inclusion and modernize the country's financial sector. While AI adoption is still in its infancy, there is a clear vision for its application across various key industries. The agricultural sector, for instance, could benefit from AI-powered crop yield forecasting, while the healthcare system could leverage AI-driven chatbots to provide essential health advice in rural areas [3]. The government is also exploring the use of AI to improve public service delivery and enhance transparency.

Despite these positive steps, Liberia's regulatory landscape for technology is still evolving. The country has a **National Information and Communications Technology Policy (2019-2024)**, which provides a framework for the development of the ICT sector [5]. In 2025, the government passed a **Cybercrime Act** to address the growing threat of digital crime [6]. The **Telecommunications Act of 2007** established the Liberia Telecommunications Authority (LTA) to regulate the telecommunications sector [7]. However, as of late 2025, Liberia does not have a comprehensive national law specifically governing artificial intelligence [8]. This regulatory gap underscores the urgent need for a dedicated AI safety and governance framework to guide the country's digital future.

## The AI Governance Gap

Liberia is one of 118 countries that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks and challenges that could undermine its development goals and the well-being of its citizens. Without a clear set of rules and regulations, the development and deployment of AI technologies can proceed in an uncontrolled and potentially harmful manner. This lack of oversight can lead to a host of problems, including algorithmic bias, which can perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities. For example, if AI is used in areas such as loan applications or hiring without proper safeguards, it could discriminate against certain groups of people.

The absence of an AI governance framework also creates significant economic risks. As the world increasingly embraces AI, countries with clear and predictable regulatory environments will be more attractive to investors and technology partners. Without such a framework, Liberia may struggle to attract the investment needed to build a vibrant AI ecosystem. Furthermore, Liberian businesses may find it difficult to compete in the global marketplace if they are not able to demonstrate that their AI systems are safe, reliable, and ethically sound. The EU's AI Act, with its stringent requirements for AI systems, will make it particularly challenging for businesses in non-compliant countries to access the European market.

The impact of this governance gap on citizens is profound. Without adequate protection, individuals may be exposed to a range of AI-related harms, from the misuse of their personal data to the spread of misinformation and disinformation. The lack of a skilled workforce and the potential for job displacement due to automation are also major concerns. For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory framework creates uncertainty and stifles innovation. Companies may be hesitant to invest in AI if they are unsure about the legal and ethical boundaries within which they must operate. This can lead to a vicious cycle, where the lack of investment hinders the development of a local AI industry, which in turn limits the opportunities for citizens to benefit from the technology.

## CSOAI's Solution for Liberia

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Liberia's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-made yet adaptable structure that can be tailored to Liberia's unique cultural, economic, and social context. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a starting point for a collaborative process of co-creation. We work closely with governments to ensure that the final framework reflects the country's specific needs and priorities. The CSOAI framework is built on a foundation of ethical principles, including fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy. It provides a clear set of guidelines for the development, deployment, and use of AI, helping to ensure that these technologies are used in a safe and responsible manner.

At the heart of our solution is the **CEASAI (Certified AI Safety Analyst) Certification**, a professional training program designed to build local capacity in AI safety and governance. This program equips individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to assess the risks and benefits of AI systems, develop and implement mitigation strategies, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. By creating a cadre of certified AI safety analysts in Liberia, we can empower the country to take ownership of its AI future and reduce its reliance on foreign expertise. The CEASAI certification is a key component of our strategy for building a sustainable AI ecosystem in Liberia.

To ensure robust and independent oversight of AI systems, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society, would be responsible for monitoring the development and deployment of AI in Liberia. The council's structure is designed to be resilient to errors and malicious actors, ensuring that its decisions are fair, impartial, and in the public interest. The council would play a crucial role in setting standards, investigating incidents, and making recommendations to the government on AI policy.

To operationalize the AI safety framework, we have developed the **SOAI-PDCA (Safety of AI - Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology**. This iterative and evidence-based approach allows organizations to continuously improve their AI safety practices. The SOAI-PDCA methodology provides a structured process for identifying and assessing risks, implementing controls, monitoring performance, and making adjustments as needed. This ensures that AI systems are not only safe at the time of deployment but remain safe throughout their lifecycle. By adopting the SOAI-PDCA methodology, Liberian organizations can build a culture of continuous improvement and demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI.

## Implementation Roadmap

The successful implementation of a national AI safety framework requires a phased and strategic approach. The CSOAI proposes a four-phase roadmap designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance in Liberia.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase of the roadmap will focus on conducting a comprehensive assessment of Liberia's current AI landscape. This will involve a detailed analysis of the country's existing legal and regulatory frameworks, digital infrastructure, and human capital. We will work closely with government officials, industry leaders, and other stakeholders to identify the key challenges and opportunities for AI adoption in Liberia. Based on this assessment, we will develop a customized AI safety framework that is tailored to the country's specific needs and priorities. This phase will culminate in the development of a detailed implementation plan, which will outline the specific actions, timelines, and resources required for the successful deployment of the framework.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In the second phase, we will work with the Government of Liberia to officially launch and deploy the national AI safety framework. This will involve a public awareness campaign to educate citizens and businesses about the new framework and its implications. We will also provide training and support to government agencies to help them understand their new roles and responsibilities. A key component of this phase will be the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, which will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the framework.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

The third phase will focus on building local capacity in AI safety and governance. Through our CEASAI certification program, we will train 1,000 AI safety analysts in Liberia. These individuals will be equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to assess the risks and benefits of AI systems, develop and implement mitigation strategies, and ensure compliance with the new regulatory framework. This will create a sustainable pool of local talent that can support the long-term growth of a responsible AI ecosystem in Liberia.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

The final phase of the roadmap will focus on achieving full operational capability. This will involve the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the AI safety framework to ensure that it remains effective and relevant. We will work with the Government of Liberia to make any necessary adjustments to the framework based on the lessons learned from its implementation. By the end of this phase, Liberia will have a robust and mature AI governance framework that is capable of supporting the country's long-term development goals.

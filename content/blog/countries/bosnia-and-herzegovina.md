# AI Safety Framework for Bosnia and Herzegovina: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Bosnia and Herzegovina stands at a critical juncture. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the nation faces a stark choice: proactively shape its AI future or risk being left behind. The absence of a national AI safety framework puts Bosnia and Herzegovina among 118 countries lacking AI governance, a precarious position that exposes its citizens and businesses to significant risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and economic disadvantages. The urgency to establish a robust AI governance structure cannot be overstated. A comprehensive AI safety framework is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for fostering innovation, attracting investment, and ensuring that the development and deployment of AI technologies are aligned with the nation's values and the well-being of its people. This is the moment for Bosnia and Herzegovina to seize the opportunity to build a secure and prosperous digital future.

## The Current State of AI in Bosnia and Herzegovina

Bosnia and Herzegovina's journey into the age of artificial intelligence is in its nascent stages, yet it holds immense promise. The nation is increasingly recognized as a burgeoning hub for IT and AI talent, with a growing number of companies specializing in machine learning, natural language processing, and software development. Key sectors, including retail and agriculture, are beginning to explore the potential of AI to enhance efficiency and drive innovation. The government has acknowledged the importance of AI in its 2021-2027 Development Strategy, signaling a commitment to digital transformation. However, this recognition has yet to translate into a concrete national AI strategy or specific regulations, leaving a significant policy vacuum. While data protection laws are in place and aligned with the EU's GDPR, the absence of a dedicated legal framework for AI creates uncertainty and potential risks. The development of a robust AI ecosystem is further supported by international organizations like the UNDP and the EU, which are actively involved in promoting digital transformation and good governance in the country. This collaborative environment, coupled with a growing talent pool, positions Bosnia and Herzegovina to leverage AI for economic growth and societal progress, provided that a comprehensive and strategic approach to AI governance is established.

## The AI Governance Gap

The absence of a dedicated AI governance framework in Bosnia and Herzegovina represents a critical vulnerability in its journey towards digital transformation. This gap places the nation in a precarious position, exposing its citizens, businesses, and institutions to a range of risks. Without clear regulations and ethical guidelines, the development and deployment of AI technologies can lead to unintended consequences, such as the amplification of biases present in data, which can in turn lead to discriminatory outcomes in areas like hiring, lending, and even criminal justice. Furthermore, the lack of a robust governance framework can erode public trust in AI, hindering its adoption and limiting its potential benefits. For businesses, the absence of clear rules creates a climate of uncertainty, making it difficult to invest in and innovate with AI technologies. This can stifle economic growth and put Bosnian companies at a competitive disadvantage in the global market. The AI governance gap is not just a theoretical problem; it has real-world implications for the rights of individuals, the fairness of society, and the economic future of the country.

## CSOAI's Solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, turnkey solution to address Bosnia and Herzegovina's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy, customizable governance structure that can be adapted to the specific needs and context of the country. This framework is built on global best practices and is designed to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a safe, ethical, and transparent manner.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI Certification program, which is designed to create a new generation of AI safety professionals in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This program provides in-depth training on our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, a proven approach to AI safety and risk management. By certifying local professionals, we empower the nation to build its own capacity for AI governance and oversight.

To ensure robust and independent oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This innovative governance model brings together a diverse group of stakeholders, including technical experts, ethicists, legal scholars, and civil society representatives, to provide a resilient and fault-tolerant system of AI oversight. The Byzantine Council is designed to prevent any single point of failure and to ensure that a wide range of perspectives are considered in AI-related decision-making.

Our SOAI-PDCA methodology provides a structured and systematic approach to AI compliance. It enables organizations to plan their AI initiatives with safety in mind, implement them in a controlled and monitored manner, check for compliance with ethical and legal standards, and act to address any issues that may arise. This iterative and adaptive approach to AI governance ensures that safety and compliance are not one-time checks but an ongoing process of improvement and adaptation.

By adopting CSOAI's solution, Bosnia and Herzegovina can rapidly close its AI governance gap, build local capacity for AI safety, and create a trusted and innovative AI ecosystem. This will not only help the country to meet the requirements of the EU AI Act but also to position itself as a leader in responsible AI development in the region.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Bosnia and Herzegovina, designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

During this initial phase, CSOAI will work closely with government stakeholders, industry leaders, and civil society organizations to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current AI landscape in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This will involve identifying key risks and opportunities, mapping existing regulatory frameworks, and developing a detailed roadmap for the implementation of the AI Safety Framework. This collaborative approach will ensure that the framework is tailored to the specific needs and priorities of the country.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In the second phase, the white-label AI Safety Framework will be deployed and customized for Bosnia and Herzegovina. This will involve establishing the legal and institutional foundations for AI governance, including the creation of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. CSOAI will provide technical assistance and capacity building to support the deployment process and to ensure that all stakeholders are equipped to fulfill their roles and responsibilities within the new framework.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

Phase three will focus on building a critical mass of local expertise in AI safety and governance. Through the CEASAI Certification program, we will train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These analysts will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to implement the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology and to provide ongoing support to public and private sector organizations in their efforts to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

In the final phase, the AI Safety Framework will become fully operational. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI will be actively overseeing the AI ecosystem, and the newly certified AI Safety Analysts will be working across the country to promote compliance and best practices. CSOAI will continue to provide ongoing support and guidance to ensure the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of the framework.

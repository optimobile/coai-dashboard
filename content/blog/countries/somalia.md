# AI Safety Framework for Somalia: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Somalia stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) present a dual-edged sword of immense opportunity and significant risk. For a nation rebuilding and embracing digital transformation, the lure of AI-driven progress is strong. However, the absence of a national AI governance framework leaves Somalia vulnerable to a host of challenges, including data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes. The upcoming EU AI Act, with its stringent requirements for AI safety and compliance, will have a global impact, affecting any Somali business or organization that interacts with the EU market. The deadline of February 2, 2026, is fast approaching. Somalia must act now to establish a robust AI safety framework to not only mitigate risks but also to foster trust, attract investment, and ensure that AI is harnessed for the benefit of all its citizens. This is not just about compliance; it's about shaping a future where AI is a tool for inclusive and sustainable development in Somalia.

## Current State of AI in Somalia

Somalia's journey with Artificial Intelligence is in its nascent stages, yet it is marked by a palpable sense of optimism and a growing recognition of AI's transformative potential. While widespread adoption is not yet a reality, pockets of innovation are emerging, driven by a youthful, tech-savvy population and a government that is increasingly embracing digital transformation. The Somali National AI Center (SNAIC), established in 2024, is a testament to this commitment, aiming to spearhead research, education, and industry adoption of AI. Key industries are beginning to explore AI applications. In the telecommunications sector, companies are looking to build green data centers to support the growing demands of the AI economy. In agriculture, AI-powered solutions are being developed for pest management and to boost crop resilience. The healthcare sector is also a key area of focus, with AI being explored for applications in diagnostics and public health. The government's digital transformation initiatives, such as the Digital Transformation Strategy (2025–2030), provide a fertile ground for the growth of AI. However, the country still lacks a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for technology, which poses a significant challenge to the responsible development and deployment of AI.

## The AI Governance Gap

Somalia is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap, while not unique to Somalia, is particularly concerning given the country's ongoing efforts to rebuild and stabilize. Without a guiding framework, Somalia faces a multitude of risks. Algorithmic bias, for instance, could perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities. The absence of robust data protection laws could lead to the misuse of personal information, eroding public trust in both government and technology. Furthermore, the lack of a clear legal and ethical framework for AI could deter foreign investment and hinder the growth of a vibrant domestic AI ecosystem. For citizens, the AI governance gap translates into a lack of protection and recourse in the face of AI-related harms. For businesses, it creates uncertainty and a challenging environment in which to innovate and compete. The global nature of AI means that even without widespread domestic adoption, Somalia is not immune to the impacts of AI systems developed and deployed elsewhere. A proactive approach to AI governance is therefore not just a matter of best practice, but a national imperative.

## CSOAI's Solution for Somalia

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, four-pronged solution designed to bridge the AI governance gap in Somalia and empower the nation to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI ecosystem. Our approach is not about imposing a one-size-fits-all model, but about providing a flexible and adaptable framework that can be tailored to Somalia's unique context and aspirations.

**1. White-label AI Safety Framework:** At the core of our offering is a white-label AI Safety Framework. This is a ready-to-deploy, comprehensive set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be customized and branded as Somalia's own national AI governance framework. Developed by leading global experts in AI safety and ethics, the framework is aligned with international standards such as the EU AI Act and NIST AI Risk Management Framework. It provides a clear roadmap for the responsible development, deployment, and use of AI across all sectors. The white-label nature of the framework allows Somalia to maintain ownership and control over its AI governance, ensuring that it reflects the country's cultural values and national priorities.

**2. CEASAI Certification for Local Professionals:** Technology is only as effective as the people who use it. That's why a key pillar of our solution is the CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts) Certification program. This program is designed to train and certify a new generation of Somali AI safety professionals. Through a rigorous curriculum that covers the technical, ethical, and legal aspects of AI safety, CEASAI certification equips individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to assess, audit, and manage AI systems. By creating a local pool of certified AI safety analysts, Somalia can build the human capacity required to implement and enforce its national AI governance framework, reducing its reliance on foreign expertise and creating high-value jobs for its citizens.

**3. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** To ensure robust and impartial oversight of the AI ecosystem, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council. This innovative governance structure is inspired by the concept of Byzantine fault tolerance, a principle from computer science that ensures a system can continue to operate even if some of its components fail or act maliciously. The council would be composed of 33 independent agents, including AI experts, ethicists, lawyers, community representatives, and government officials. This diversity of perspectives, combined with the council's decentralized structure, would make it highly resilient to bias, corruption, and undue influence. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the national AI safety framework, investigating AI-related incidents, and providing guidance on emerging AI governance challenges.

**4. SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** To ensure that AI systems remain safe and compliant over time, we have developed the SOAI-PDCA (Safety of AI - Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology. This is a continuous improvement cycle that helps organizations to systematically manage their AI risks and obligations. The **Plan** phase involves identifying AI risks and developing a plan to mitigate them. The **Do** phase involves implementing the plan and putting the necessary controls in place. The **Check** phase involves monitoring the effectiveness of the controls and assessing compliance with the national AI safety framework. The **Act** phase involves taking corrective action to address any identified gaps or weaknesses. The SOAI-PDCA methodology provides a practical and structured approach to AI compliance, enabling organizations to build and maintain trust with their customers, partners, and regulators.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Somalia, designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition towards a safe and responsible AI ecosystem. This four-phase roadmap is designed to be completed within a 24-month timeframe, with clear milestones and deliverables at each stage.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** The first phase will focus on conducting a comprehensive assessment of Somalia's current AI landscape. This will involve engaging with key stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society to understand their needs, concerns, and priorities. The findings of this assessment will be used to develop a detailed implementation plan, including a customized version of the white-label AI Safety Framework that is tailored to Somalia's specific context.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** The second phase will involve the official launch and deployment of the national AI Safety Framework. This will be accompanied by a nationwide awareness campaign to educate the public and key stakeholders about the importance of AI safety and the new regulatory requirements. During this phase, we will also work with government agencies and other relevant organizations to integrate the framework into their existing policies and procedures.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months):** The third phase is the most critical and intensive part of the roadmap. It will focus on building the human capacity needed to implement and enforce the AI Safety Framework. Through the CEASAI Certification program, we will train and certify 1,000 Somali AI safety analysts. This will be achieved through a combination of online and in-person training, delivered in partnership with local universities and training institutions.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (3 months):** The final phase will focus on achieving full operational capability. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight and the full implementation of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology across all relevant sectors. By the end of this phase, Somalia will have a robust and self-sustaining AI governance ecosystem, with the capacity to manage the risks and harness the opportunities of AI for the benefit of all its citizens.

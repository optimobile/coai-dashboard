# AI Safety Framework for Guatemala: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Guatemala stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents immense opportunities for economic growth and societal advancement. However, without a robust governance framework, the nation also faces significant risks, including algorithmic bias, job displacement, and threats to data privacy and security. With the European Union's AI Act set to take effect on February 2, 2026, establishing a national AI safety framework is no longer a strategic choice but a pressing necessity. This urgency is compounded by the fact that Guatemala is one of 118 countries currently without a formal AI governance strategy. Proactive adoption of a comprehensive AI safety framework will not only mitigate risks but also position Guatemala as a leader in responsible AI adoption in Central America, fostering trust and attracting investment in its burgeoning digital economy. The time to act is now.

## Current State of AI in Guatemala

Guatemala is experiencing a steady and significant integration of Artificial Intelligence across various sectors, signaling a pivotal shift in its economic and social landscape. While still in the early stages of adoption compared to global leaders, the country is demonstrating a growing appetite for AI-driven technologies. This adoption is most prominent in the **Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)** industry, where AI tools are being implemented to revolutionize customer interaction management, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance operational efficiency, with some companies reporting up to a 30% reduction in operating costs. The nation is also attracting investment in AI infrastructure, with companies like KIO and Aurum developing state-of-the-art data centers with AI capabilities. These developments are positioning Guatemala as an emerging digital hub in the region.

Several key industries are at the forefront of AI adoption. Beyond the BPO sector, AI is making inroads into **finance, retail, and agriculture**. Financial institutions are leveraging AI for fraud detection, credit scoring, and personalized banking services. In retail, AI is being used for inventory management, supply chain optimization, and to create personalized customer experiences. Even in the agricultural sector, which has long been a cornerstone of the Guatemalan economy, AI is being explored for crop monitoring, yield prediction, and precision agriculture, promising to enhance productivity and sustainability.

The Guatemalan government has recognized the transformative potential of AI and has embarked on several **digital transformation initiatives**. The Presidential Commission for Open and Electronic Government is actively exploring data-sharing models to strengthen government digital transformation. These initiatives aim to modernize public services, reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, and improve citizen engagement. Furthermore, international organizations and private sector partners are supporting these efforts, with a focus on creating a rights-based approach to digital transformation that ensures inclusivity and protects fundamental human rights. Projects like the "Guatemala Joven Conversa" initiative, which uses AI-enabled dialogues to boost youth political participation, highlight the potential of AI to foster a more inclusive and democratic society. While Guatemala is making strides in its digital journey, the absence of a dedicated AI regulatory framework underscores the need for a structured approach to governance to ensure that the benefits of AI are maximized while potential harms are mitigated.

## The AI Governance Gap

Guatemala is currently among 118 countries that have not yet established a formal AI governance framework. This AI governance gap, while not unique to Guatemala, presents a series of profound risks that could undermine the nation's economic potential and societal well-being. Without a clear regulatory landscape, businesses are hesitant to invest in and deploy AI technologies, fearing legal uncertainty and potential liabilities. This stifles innovation and puts Guatemalan companies at a competitive disadvantage in the global market. The absence of a national strategy also means that the development and deployment of AI systems are largely unregulated, leaving citizens vulnerable to a range of harms.

The risks of this governance vacuum are multifaceted. For citizens, the lack of oversight can lead to **algorithmic bias** in critical areas such as hiring, lending, and even criminal justice, perpetuating and amplifying existing social inequalities. The unregulated collection and use of personal data for training AI models also pose a significant threat to **privacy and data security**. Furthermore, the rapid automation of tasks without a corresponding strategy for workforce transition could lead to widespread **job displacement** and economic disruption. For businesses, the absence of a clear legal framework creates a climate of uncertainty, hindering long-term investment and exposing them to reputational damage and potential legal challenges. The lack of a national AI strategy also makes it difficult for Guatemala to participate in and shape international conversations on AI governance, potentially leaving the country subject to regulations and standards set by other nations.

## CSOAI's Solution for Guatemala

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to address the specific needs and challenges of nations like Guatemala. Our solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a customizable framework that can be adapted to the local context, ensuring cultural and legal alignment. The framework provides a clear and actionable roadmap for developing a national AI strategy, encompassing everything from ethical guidelines and risk management protocols to data governance and public engagement strategies. By adopting the CSOAI framework, Guatemala can rapidly bridge the AI governance gap, fostering an environment of trust and safety that encourages innovation and investment.

At the heart of our solution is the **CEASAI Certification**, a professional certification for AI safety analysts. This program is designed to build local capacity by training and certifying a new generation of AI safety professionals in Guatemala. These certified analysts will be equipped with the skills and knowledge to assess the safety and compliance of AI systems, ensuring that they are aligned with national and international standards. The CEASAI certification program is delivered through a combination of online learning and hands-on training, making it accessible to a wide range of professionals, from recent graduates to experienced IT professionals.

To ensure robust and impartial oversight, the CSOAI framework includes the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders including government officials, industry experts, academics, and civil society representatives, is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the AI safety framework. The council's unique 33-agent structure is designed to ensure resilience and prevent any single point of failure, providing a robust and trustworthy mechanism for AI governance. The council will be responsible for reviewing and approving AI systems, investigating incidents, and making recommendations for policy and regulatory changes.

Finally, our **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology** provides a structured and iterative approach to AI safety and compliance. Based on the well-established Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, this methodology enables organizations to continuously monitor, assess, and improve the safety and performance of their AI systems. The SOAI-PDCA methodology is supported by a suite of tools and resources that help organizations to streamline the compliance process, reduce costs, and demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI. By adopting this methodology, Guatemalan businesses can not only ensure compliance with national and international regulations but also build a culture of safety and trust that will be a key differentiator in the global market.

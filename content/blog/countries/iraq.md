# AI Safety Framework for Iraq: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Iraq stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence present both immense opportunities and significant risks. As the nation continues its digital transformation journey, the absence of a comprehensive AI safety and governance framework exposes its citizens, businesses, and critical infrastructure to potential harm. The upcoming EU AI Act, with its deadline of February 2, 2026, will set a global benchmark for AI regulation, impacting international trade and collaboration. For Iraq to harness the benefits of AI while safeguarding its national interests, the time to act is now. Establishing a robust AI safety framework is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for fostering innovation, building trust, and ensuring that AI is developed and deployed responsibly and ethically for the benefit of all Iraqis. This will not only mitigate risks but also position Iraq as a responsible player in the global digital economy, attracting investment and fostering a new generation of AI-savvy professionals.

## The Current State of AI in Iraq

Iraq's journey with Artificial Intelligence is in its nascent stages, characterized by a mix of burgeoning interest and significant structural challenges. While the nation has not yet witnessed widespread AI adoption on the scale of its regional neighbors, there are pockets of innovation and a growing recognition of AI's transformative potential. Key industries such as healthcare and energy are beginning to explore AI applications for enhancing diagnostics, optimizing treatment plans, and improving energy efficiency. In the academic sphere, Iraqi universities are increasingly focusing on AI, both as a subject of research and as a tool to be integrated into the educational landscape. This is evidenced by studies on the adoption of open-source software and AI capabilities within higher education institutions.

The Iraqi government has also embarked on an ambitious digital transformation agenda, which serves as a foundational layer for future AI integration. Initiatives such as the launch of electronic signatures for state institutions and the private sector, the expansion of the national fiber-optic network, and the development of smart cities are all critical enablers for a data-driven economy. As of late 2025, 859 government entities have adopted e-governance systems, a significant step towards reducing bureaucracy and modernizing public services. However, the Government AI Readiness Index still places Iraq among the lower-ranking countries in the Middle East and North Africa, highlighting substantial gaps in AI strategy, tech sector maturity, and data infrastructure.

From a regulatory perspective, Iraq's legal framework for technology is still evolving. While there is no dedicated, comprehensive data protection law, the Communications and Media Commission (CMC) regulates the telecommunications and information technology sectors. The country has also recently issued new regulations for short-range and ultra-wideband devices to align with international standards. Nevertheless, the absence of a specific legal and ethical framework for AI creates a precarious environment for both developers and users, leaving critical questions about data privacy, accountability, and algorithmic bias unanswered. This regulatory gap, coupled with the foundational challenges in infrastructure and talent development, underscores the urgent need for a proactive and comprehensive approach to AI governance.

## The AI Governance Gap

Iraq is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap is not merely a matter of policy but a significant national vulnerability. In an era where AI is becoming increasingly embedded in the fabric of society, the absence of a guiding framework creates a vacuum, leaving the nation exposed to a myriad of risks. Without clear regulations and ethical guidelines, the development and deployment of AI systems can proceed unchecked, potentially leading to a host of negative consequences for citizens and businesses alike.

The risks of this governance gap are manifold. From a societal perspective, the unregulated use of AI can exacerbate existing inequalities, introduce new forms of discrimination, and erode privacy. For instance, biased algorithms in areas such as loan applications or hiring processes could disproportionately disadvantage certain segments of the population. The lack of transparency and accountability in AI systems can also lead to a breakdown of trust between citizens and institutions. From an economic standpoint, the absence of a clear regulatory environment can deter foreign investment and hinder the growth of a domestic AI industry. Businesses may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies without the legal certainty that a governance framework provides.

Furthermore, the AI governance gap has significant implications for national security. The malicious use of AI, whether by state or non-state actors, poses a credible threat to critical infrastructure, financial systems, and even the democratic process. Without a robust governance framework, Iraq will find it challenging to defend against such threats and to ensure that AI is used in a manner that is consistent with its national interests. The global landscape is rapidly moving towards greater AI regulation, and countries that fail to keep pace risk being left behind, both economically and strategically.

## CSOAI's Solution for Iraq

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to be adapted and deployed by nations like Iraq that are seeking to establish robust AI governance. Our solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a flexible and scalable framework that can be tailored to the specific needs and context of Iraq. It is built upon four key pillars:

**1. White-label AI Safety Framework:** CSOAI provides a ready-to-deploy, comprehensive AI safety framework that can be customized and branded as Iraq's own national AI governance standard. This framework includes a set of policies, standards, and best practices for the responsible development, deployment, and use of AI. It covers a wide range of issues, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, accountability, and security. By adopting this framework, Iraq can rapidly establish a world-class AI governance regime without having to start from scratch.

**2. CEASAI Certification:** A crucial component of our solution is the Certified European AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program. This program is designed to create a new generation of AI safety professionals in Iraq. Through a rigorous training and certification process, CEASAI equips individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to assess the safety and compliance of AI systems. This not only helps to build local capacity but also creates high-value job opportunities for Iraqi citizens. The CEASAI certification is designed to be recognized globally, ensuring that Iraqi AI safety professionals are at the forefront of this emerging field.

**3. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** At the heart of our technical solution is the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, a decentralized AI-powered oversight mechanism. This innovative approach to AI governance utilizes a network of 33 independent AI agents to monitor and audit AI systems in real-time. The Byzantine Fault Tolerance model ensures that the council can reach a reliable consensus on the safety and compliance of an AI system, even if some of the agents are compromised or malfunctioning. This provides a high degree of assurance and resilience, which is essential for building trust in AI.

**4. SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** To ensure continuous improvement, our framework incorporates the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology. This is an iterative, four-stage management cycle that enables organizations to continuously improve their AI safety and compliance posture. The SOAI-PDCA methodology provides a structured approach for identifying and mitigating risks, as well as for adapting to the evolving AI landscape. It is a dynamic and proactive approach to governance that goes beyond static, one-time assessments.

By combining these four pillars, CSOAI offers a holistic and effective solution for Iraq to build a robust and resilient AI governance framework. Our approach is designed to be both comprehensive and practical, enabling Iraq to navigate the complexities of the AI era with confidence.

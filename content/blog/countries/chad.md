# AI Safety Framework for Chad: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

The global race to harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) is well underway, and Chad stands at a critical juncture. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Chad to establish a robust AI safety framework is now. The nation's nascent digital ecosystem, coupled with a youthful population, presents a unique opportunity to build a future-proof AI governance structure from the ground up. Proactive adoption of a comprehensive AI safety framework will not only mitigate potential risks but also unlock significant economic and social benefits, positioning Chad as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the region. This is not merely a matter of compliance; it is a strategic imperative for national development, security, and sovereignty in the digital age. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to help Chad navigate this complex landscape, ensuring that the nation's journey into the AI era is both safe and prosperous.

## Current State of AI in Chad

Chad's engagement with artificial intelligence is in its early stages, characterized by a growing awareness of its potential and a clear need for foundational infrastructure and human capital development. While widespread AI adoption is not yet a reality, there are pockets of innovation and a growing government commitment to digital transformation. Key sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, and public administration are beginning to explore AI-powered solutions to address long-standing challenges. For instance, AI could be used to analyze satellite imagery for precision agriculture, improve disease surveillance and diagnosis in healthcare, and enhance the efficiency of public services.

The Chadian government has demonstrated its commitment to embracing the digital future through several initiatives. The "Chad Connection 2030" strategy, a $1.5 billion plan, aims to accelerate the country's digital transformation by expanding internet access and digitizing public services. Furthermore, the government has launched a nationwide initiative to train 2,000 young people in artificial intelligence, a crucial step towards building a skilled workforce. Chad's recent election to the African Council on Artificial Intelligence further underscores its commitment to playing an active role in shaping the continent's AI landscape.

However, significant challenges remain. Chad has one of the lowest internet penetration rates in the world, a major obstacle to the widespread adoption and regulation of AI. The country also lacks a dedicated regulatory framework for AI, which creates uncertainty for businesses and investors. Addressing these infrastructure and regulatory gaps will be crucial for unlocking the full potential of AI in Chad.

## The AI Governance Gap

Chad is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This "AI governance gap" exposes the nation to a range of risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and the potential for AI systems to be used for malicious purposes. Without a clear regulatory framework, citizens and businesses are left vulnerable to the potential harms of unchecked AI development and deployment.

The absence of a national AI strategy can also stifle innovation and economic growth. Businesses may be hesitant to invest in AI without clear rules of the road, and the lack of a skilled workforce can further hinder adoption. Moreover, as other countries and regions, such as the European Union, move forward with their own AI regulations, Chad risks being left behind, unable to participate fully in the global digital economy.

The impact on citizens could be profound. From biased loan application algorithms to the spread of misinformation, the misuse of AI can have a detrimental effect on people's lives. For businesses, the lack of a clear regulatory framework can create a climate of uncertainty, making it difficult to plan for the future and compete on a level playing field.

## CSOAI's Solution for Chad

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to help countries like Chad navigate the complexities of AI governance. Our solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach; it is a customizable framework that can be adapted to Chad's specific needs and priorities.

At the core of our offering is the **CEASAI Certification**, a professional certification for AI safety analysts. This program is designed to create a pipeline of local talent, empowering Chadians to become leaders in the field of AI safety. By training a cadre of certified professionals, Chad can build the in-house expertise needed to oversee the development and deployment of AI systems.

To ensure robust oversight, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**. This independent body, composed of diverse stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society, would be responsible for setting AI safety standards, conducting audits, and investigating incidents. The council's Byzantine fault-tolerant design ensures its resilience and integrity, even in the face of potential bad actors.

Our **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** provides a structured approach to AI safety. This iterative process helps organizations to continuously improve their AI safety practices, ensuring that they remain in compliance with evolving regulations and best practices. By adopting the SOAI-PDCA methodology, Chadian organizations can build a culture of AI safety from the ground up.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a four-phase implementation roadmap to help Chad build a comprehensive AI safety framework:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** In this initial phase, we will work with Chadian stakeholders to conduct a thorough assessment of the country's current AI landscape, identify key risks and opportunities, and develop a customized AI safety roadmap.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will deploy the CSOAI AI Safety Framework, including the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI and the adoption of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** We will launch a nationwide training program to certify 1,000 Chadian AI safety analysts. This will create a sustainable pool of local talent to support the long-term success of the AI safety framework.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In this final phase, the AI safety framework will be fully operational, with the Byzantine Council providing ongoing oversight and the certified AI safety analysts working to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI across the country.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, CSOAI is proud to announce a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including aspiring AI safety professionals in Chad. This is a unique opportunity for Chadian citizens to gain the skills and knowledge needed to participate in the fast-growing field of AI safety.

By taking advantage of this free training, Chad can immediately begin to build its capacity in AI safety, creating a new generation of experts who can help to shape the country's AI future. This is not just about training individuals; it is about building a national capability that will be essential for navigating the challenges and opportunities of the AI era.

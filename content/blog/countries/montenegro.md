# AI Safety Framework for Montenegro: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a comprehensive AI safety framework in Montenegro has never been more urgent. As a candidate for EU membership, Montenegro must align its legal and regulatory structures with EU standards, and this includes the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. The absence of a national AI strategy or specific legislation creates a significant governance gap, leaving the nation vulnerable to the risks associated with unchecked AI development. These risks include threats to data privacy, algorithmic bias, and a lack of accountability, which can erode public trust and hinder economic growth. A proactive approach to AI governance is not just a matter of compliance; it is a strategic imperative for ensuring that AI is developed and deployed in a safe, ethical, and beneficial manner for all Montenegrin citizens and businesses. The time to act is now.

## Current State of AI in Montenegro

Montenegro is in the early stages of AI adoption, with a growing awareness of its potential to drive economic growth and improve public services. While there is no official national AI strategy, the government has shown a commitment to digital transformation through initiatives like the Digital Transformation Strategy 2022–2026. This strategy aims to modernize public administration, enhance cybersecurity, and promote the development of a digital economy. The IT sector is a key driver of AI innovation in Montenegro, with several startups and established companies exploring AI-powered solutions. For instance, Uhura Solutions, a Montenegrin company, is using AI to automate contract analysis. The tourism sector, a cornerstone of Montenegro's economy, is also beginning to leverage AI for personalized marketing and improved customer service. Other industries showing potential for AI adoption include finance, healthcare, and logistics. However, the lack of a clear regulatory framework and a shortage of skilled AI professionals are significant barriers to wider adoption. The government's AI Readiness Assessment Report, developed in partnership with the UNDP, is a crucial first step in identifying the challenges and opportunities for AI in the country. This report will provide a roadmap for developing a national AI strategy and fostering a vibrant AI ecosystem in Montenegro.

## The AI Governance Gap

Montenegro is one of 118 countries that have not yet implemented a comprehensive AI governance framework. This governance gap exposes the country to a range of risks, including the misuse of personal data, the proliferation of biased algorithms, and a lack of accountability for AI-related harms. Without clear regulations, businesses may be hesitant to invest in AI, and citizens may be reluctant to trust AI-powered services. The absence of a national AI strategy also means that Montenegro is missing out on the opportunity to shape the development of AI in a way that aligns with its national values and priorities. As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, the need for a robust governance framework becomes increasingly critical. Such a framework would not only mitigate the risks of AI but also unlock its full potential to drive innovation, economic growth, and social progress. By taking a proactive approach to AI governance, Montenegro can position itself as a leader in the responsible development and deployment of AI.

## CSOAI's Solution for Montenegro

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive solution to help Montenegro bridge the AI governance gap and build a safe and prosperous AI-powered future. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-use set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be customized to meet Montenegro's specific needs. The framework is based on our proprietary SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, which ensures that AI systems are developed and deployed in a safe, ethical, and transparent manner. To support the implementation of the framework, we offer the CEASAI (Certified Expert in AI Safety and Auditing) certification program, which will train a new generation of AI safety professionals in Montenegro. These certified experts will form a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, a decentralized body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the AI safety framework and ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations. This multi-faceted approach will not only help Montenegro meet its EU AI Act obligations but also foster a culture of responsible AI innovation that will benefit all citizens and businesses.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a four-phase implementation roadmap to help Montenegro deploy its AI safety framework quickly and effectively:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** In this phase, we will work with the Montenegrin government to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the country's AI landscape and develop a customized implementation plan.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will deploy the AI safety framework and establish the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** In this phase, we will train 1,000 Montenegrin citizens to become certified AI safety analysts through our CEASAI program.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In this phase, the AI safety framework will be fully operational, and the Byzantine Council will be actively monitoring the implementation of the framework and ensuring compliance with all relevant regulations.

# AI Safety Framework for Papua New Guinea: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Papua New Guinea to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. The nation stands at a critical juncture where the decisions made today will shape its technological future and either expose it to significant risks or position it as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the Pacific. The absence of a national AI strategy leaves Papua New Guinea vulnerable to a range of threats, including algorithmic bias, data privacy breaches, and economic disruption. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to harness the transformative power of AI for sustainable development, economic growth, and the well-being of its citizens. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this governance gap, providing a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a proven methodology to build a robust and resilient AI ecosystem.

## Current State of AI in Papua New Guinea

Papua New Guinea's journey into the age of artificial intelligence is in its nascent stages, characterized by a growing awareness of AI's potential and a government-led push for digital transformation. While widespread AI adoption is not yet a reality, the foundational elements are being laid. The government's Digital Transformation Policy, spearheaded by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), is a clear indication of the nation's commitment to embracing technology for national development. Prime Minister James Marape has declared ICT and AI as the "engine of PNG's next 50 years," highlighting the strategic importance of these technologies.

Currently, AI adoption is most visible in the public sector, with initiatives like the GovCloud and the SevisPass Digital ID aiming to improve efficiency and service delivery across more than 146 government agencies. In the private sector, key industries such as mining, agriculture, and finance are beginning to explore AI applications for process optimization, risk management, and customer service. However, the lack of a skilled workforce and robust digital infrastructure remains a significant barrier to broader adoption.

Papua New Guinea has made strides in establishing a regulatory framework for the digital economy with the Digital Government Act and the NICT Act. These legislations provide a foundation for ICT governance, cybersecurity, and data privacy. However, they do not specifically address the unique challenges and risks posed by artificial intelligence. This regulatory gap, coupled with the rapid pace of technological advancement, underscores the urgent need for a dedicated AI governance framework.

## The AI Governance Gap

Papua New Guinea is one of 118 countries that have yet to establish a national AI governance framework. This "governance gap" exposes the nation to a multitude of risks that could undermine its economic development, social stability, and national security. Without a clear set of rules and standards for the development and deployment of AI, Papua New Guinea is at risk of becoming a digital colony, dependent on foreign technologies and vulnerable to exploitation.

The absence of an AI safety framework can have a profound impact on citizens and businesses. For citizens, it can lead to the erosion of privacy, the amplification of misinformation, and the perpetuation of algorithmic bias in areas such as loan applications, job recruitment, and law enforcement. For businesses, the lack of regulatory certainty can stifle innovation, deter investment, and create an unlevel playing field where responsible actors are disadvantaged.

Furthermore, the AI governance gap can exacerbate existing inequalities and create new forms of social exclusion. Without a concerted effort to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared equitably, there is a risk that the technology will only serve to widen the gap between the digital haves and have-nots. A national AI safety framework is therefore not just a technical or legal necessity but a moral and ethical imperative.

## CSOAI's Solution for Papua New Guinea

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Papua New Guinea's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be adapted to the specific needs and context of the nation. The framework is designed to be fully compliant with international standards, including the EU AI Act, ensuring that Papua New Guinea can seamlessly integrate into the global digital economy.

At the heart of our solution is the Certified AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program, a professional certification that will empower local professionals with the skills and knowledge to design, implement, and audit AI systems. By creating a cadre of certified AI safety experts, Papua New Guinea can build the local capacity needed to sustain a vibrant and responsible AI ecosystem.

To ensure robust oversight and accountability, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, an independent body of experts from diverse fields to provide guidance and oversight on all matters related to AI. This council will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the national AI safety framework, investigating incidents, and making recommendations to the government.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI governance, enabling organizations to continuously improve their AI safety posture. This methodology is supported by a suite of tools and resources to help organizations assess their risks, implement controls, and monitor their performance.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a four-phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Papua New Guinea:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Papua New Guinea's existing digital infrastructure, regulatory landscape, and workforce capacity. Based on this assessment, we will work with the government to develop a detailed implementation plan and roadmap.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework and establish the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. We will also launch a public awareness campaign to educate citizens and businesses about the importance of AI safety.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** This phase will focus on building local capacity through the CEASAI certification program. We will work with local universities and training institutions to train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In this final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with the Byzantine Council providing ongoing oversight and the certified AI Safety Analysts supporting the responsible adoption of AI across all sectors of the economy.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building a global community of AI safety professionals, the CSOAI is offering a £1 billion training giveaway. Through this initiative, citizens of Papua New Guinea can access the CEASAI certification program for free, enabling them to acquire the skills and qualifications needed to participate in the digital economy. We are training 500,250 analysts globally, creating a massive pool of talent that can be deployed to support the responsible development and deployment of AI.

This initiative represents a unique opportunity for Papua New Guinea to leapfrog other nations and build a world-class AI workforce. By taking advantage of this offer, Papua New Guinea can create immediate capacity, attract investment, and position itself as a hub for AI innovation in the Pacific.

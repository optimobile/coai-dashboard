# AI Safety Framework for Armenia: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Armenia to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework is now. As a nation with a burgeoning technology sector and increasing AI adoption, a proactive approach to AI governance is not just a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative. A robust framework will enable Armenia to mitigate the risks associated with AI, from data privacy and algorithmic bias to national security threats, while fostering an environment of trust and innovation. By acting now, Armenia can position itself as a regional leader in responsible AI development, attract investment, and ensure that the benefits of AI are shared by all its citizens. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to help Armenia achieve this, providing a clear path to a secure and prosperous AI-powered future.

## Current State of AI in Armenia

Armenia is currently experiencing a significant transformation, positioning itself as an emerging hub for artificial intelligence in the region. This is driven by a combination of government initiatives, private sector investment, and a vibrant technology ecosystem. A landmark $500 million project to establish an AI supercomputing center in partnership with Nvidia is set to revolutionize the country's technological capabilities. This initiative, along with a government-approved AI pilot program in collaboration with Amazon Web Services, underscores the national commitment to embracing AI-driven innovation.

AI adoption is steadily increasing across various key industries. The agrifood sector is leveraging AI for enhanced productivity and sustainability, while the financial sector is exploring AI-powered solutions for e-commerce and healthcare. The Armenian government is also piloting the use of AI in tax administration to improve compliance, risk management, and fraud detection. These developments are part of a broader digital transformation strategy aimed at modernizing the economy and enhancing public services.

However, despite these promising advancements, Armenia's overall AI diffusion rate of 6.2% lags behind its neighbors. Furthermore, the country currently lacks a specific legal framework to govern the development and deployment of AI technologies. While Armenia has signaled its commitment to ethical AI by joining the Council of Europe's Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence, there is a pressing need to translate this commitment into concrete national regulations. The absence of a comprehensive governance framework creates a critical gap that could hinder Armenia's ability to fully capitalize on the opportunities presented by AI while mitigating its inherent risks.

## The AI Governance Gap

Armenia is one of 118 countries worldwide that have yet to implement a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks that could have profound consequences for its citizens, businesses, and national security. Without clear regulations, there is a heightened danger of algorithmic bias, which can perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities. The lack of data protection standards in AI applications also exposes citizens to privacy violations and the misuse of their personal information.

For businesses, the absence of a predictable legal environment creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and can deter foreign investment. Companies may be hesitant to develop and deploy AI solutions in a market where the rules are unclear, and the potential for legal and reputational damage is high. Furthermore, without a national AI strategy, Armenia risks falling behind in the global race for AI dominance, potentially becoming a consumer of foreign AI technologies rather than a producer of its own.

The impact on citizens extends beyond data privacy concerns. The unregulated use of AI in areas such as law enforcement and justice could lead to miscarriages of justice and the erosion of fundamental rights. The spread of AI-generated misinformation and disinformation also poses a significant threat to social cohesion and democratic processes. To address these challenges and unlock the full potential of AI, it is imperative that Armenia develops a robust and comprehensive AI governance framework that is tailored to its specific needs and values.

## CSOAI's Solution for Armenia

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to help nations like Armenia navigate the complexities of AI governance. Our solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a customizable framework that can be adapted to Armenia's unique legal, cultural, and economic context. The framework provides a clear set of guidelines, standards, and best practices for the development, deployment, and oversight of AI systems, ensuring that they are safe, ethical, and aligned with national priorities.

At the core of our offering is the CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts International) certification program. This program is designed to create a new generation of local AI safety experts who can lead the implementation and oversight of the national AI framework. By training and certifying local professionals, we empower Armenia to build its own capacity for AI governance, reducing its reliance on foreign expertise and ensuring that the framework is implemented in a way that is sensitive to the local context.

To ensure robust and impartial oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This decentralized body, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society, would be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the AI framework, investigating incidents, and making recommendations for its continuous improvement. The Byzantine Fault Tolerance model ensures that the council can reach a consensus even if some of its members are unreliable or malicious, providing a high level of assurance against regulatory capture and corruption.

Finally, our SOAI-PDCA (Safety of AI - Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured approach to AI safety management. This iterative cycle of planning, implementing, monitoring, and improving AI safety measures enables organizations to continuously enhance their AI governance practices and adapt to the evolving technological landscape. By adopting this methodology, Armenian businesses and government agencies can demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI and build trust with their customers and citizens.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI has developed a four-phase implementation roadmap to guide Armenia on its journey to full AI operational capability. This roadmap is designed to be completed within a 12-month timeframe, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase involves a comprehensive assessment of Armenia's current AI landscape, including its existing legal and regulatory framework, technological infrastructure, and human capital. This assessment will be conducted in close collaboration with Armenian stakeholders to ensure that the proposed AI safety framework is tailored to the country's specific needs and priorities. The output of this phase will be a detailed implementation plan, including a customized version of the CSOAI framework and a roadmap for its adoption.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In the second phase, the customized AI safety framework will be deployed across the country. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, the adoption of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology by government agencies and key industries, and the launch of a public awareness campaign to educate citizens about the benefits and risks of AI.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

The third phase focuses on building local capacity for AI governance through the training and certification of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts. This will be achieved through the CEASAI certification program, which will be delivered in partnership with Armenian universities and training institutions. The newly certified analysts will play a crucial role in the implementation and oversight of the national AI framework.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

The final phase marks the achievement of full operational capability, with the AI safety framework fully integrated into the national legal and regulatory landscape. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI will be fully operational, and the 1,000 certified AI Safety Analysts will be actively engaged in monitoring and enforcing the framework. This will create a sustainable and self-sufficient AI governance ecosystem that can adapt to the evolving challenges and opportunities of the AI era.

# AI Safety Framework for Nepal: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Nepal to establish a national AI safety framework has never been greater. As a nation poised for significant technological advancement, Nepal stands at a critical juncture. The decisions made today will determine whether AI becomes a catalyst for inclusive growth or a source of new societal divides. A proactive approach to AI governance is not merely a matter of compliance with international standards; it is a strategic imperative to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a manner that is safe, ethical, and aligned with Nepal's national interests. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive solution to help Nepal navigate this complex landscape, providing a clear roadmap to a future where AI is a force for good.

## Current State of AI in Nepal

Nepal, a nation known for its rich cultural heritage and breathtaking landscapes, is on the cusp of a technological revolution. The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is steadily gaining momentum, promising to reshape industries, improve public services, and drive economic growth. However, the path to an AI-powered future is not without its challenges. Understanding the current state of AI in Nepal is crucial to appreciating the urgent need for a comprehensive AI safety and governance framework.

### AI Adoption and Usage

AI adoption in Nepal is still in its nascent stages, but it is expanding across various domains, including industry, healthcare, education, disaster management, and public services. The government's endorsement of the National AI Policy in August 2025 signals a strong commitment to fostering an AI-driven ecosystem. This policy aims to achieve the digital transformation envisioned by the Digital Nepal Framework (DNF), which identifies seven key sectors for technological intervention: smart infrastructure, agriculture, health, tourism, education, finance, and governance.

Despite the government's enthusiasm, Nepal's readiness for AI is ranked 139th out of 181 countries, highlighting weaknesses in infrastructure, skills, and the innovation ecosystem. The country's digital divide remains a significant barrier to widespread AI adoption, with disparities in internet access and digital literacy between urban and rural areas.

### Key Industries Using AI

Several key industries in Nepal are beginning to harness the power of AI to enhance their operations and services:

*   **Healthcare:** AI-powered diagnostic tools are being explored to assist doctors in diagnosing diseases more accurately, particularly in remote areas with limited access to specialists. Telemedicine platforms are also gaining traction, enabling remote consultations and reducing the strain on urban healthcare facilities.
*   **Agriculture:** As the backbone of Nepal's economy, the agriculture sector stands to benefit significantly from AI. Precision agriculture techniques, using data from drones and satellites, can help farmers optimize crop yields, manage resources efficiently, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
*   **Finance:** The financial sector is another early adopter of AI, with banks and financial institutions using AI-powered tools for fraud detection, credit scoring, and customer service.
*   **Tourism:** AI is being used to personalize travel experiences, from targeted marketing to AI-powered chatbots that provide real-time information to tourists.

### Government Digital Transformation Initiatives

The Nepalese government has launched several initiatives to accelerate digital transformation and create a conducive environment for AI development. The Digital Nepal Framework (DNF) is a comprehensive roadmap for leveraging technology to drive economic growth and improve public services. The establishment of the National Artificial Intelligence Centre in November 2025 is another significant step towards advancing digital transformation across public and private sectors.

### Existing Technology Regulations

Nepal has some existing technology regulations, but they are not yet comprehensive enough to address the complexities of AI. The Individual Privacy Act, 2018, and the Individual Privacy Regulation, 2020, provide a legal framework for data protection. The Telecommunications Act, 1997, regulates the telecommunications sector. However, there is a need for a more robust legal and ethical framework to govern the development and deployment of AI, ensuring that it is used responsibly and does not exacerbate existing inequalities.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite the promising strides in AI adoption and the government's forward-looking vision, Nepal currently finds itself in a precarious position. It is one of 118 countries that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This AI governance gap exposes the nation to a multitude of risks, with significant implications for its citizens, businesses, and the overall trajectory of its digital future. The absence of a regulatory framework for AI can be attributed to a combination of factors, including a primary focus on building foundational digital infrastructure, a shortage of AI-specific legal and technical expertise, and the rapid pace of technological advancement that often outstrips the legislative process.

The risks associated with this governance vacuum are multifaceted. Without clear ethical guidelines and standards, there is a heightened risk of biased algorithms perpetuating and even amplifying existing social inequalities. For instance, AI systems used in recruitment or loan applications could discriminate against individuals based on their gender, ethnicity, or geographical location. Furthermore, the lack of data protection regulations tailored to AI raises serious concerns about the privacy and security of citizens' data. In a world where data is the new oil, the absence of robust safeguards can lead to the misuse and exploitation of personal information, eroding public trust in AI and digital services.

For businesses, the absence of a clear regulatory landscape creates uncertainty and stifles innovation. Companies may be hesitant to invest in AI technologies without clear rules of the road, fearing potential legal and reputational risks. This can put Nepalese businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global market, where AI is increasingly becoming a key driver of productivity and growth. Moreover, without a national AI governance framework, Nepal may struggle to attract foreign investment in its technology sector, as international partners are often wary of operating in unregulated environments.

## CSOAI's Solution for Nepal

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Nepal's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework is designed to be adapted to the specific needs and context of each country, providing a ready-to-deploy solution that can be implemented quickly and efficiently. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach; rather, it is a flexible and modular system that can be tailored to Nepal's unique social, economic, and technological realities.

At the core of our solution is the **CEASAI Certification**, a globally recognized qualification for AI safety professionals. By training and certifying local talent, we aim to build a sustainable ecosystem of AI safety expertise within Nepal. This will not only ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI but also create high-skilled job opportunities for Nepalese citizens. Our goal is to train 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Nepal, creating a critical mass of professionals who can lead the charge in building a safe and ethical AI future for the country.

To ensure robust oversight and accountability, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight**. This council, composed of a diverse group of stakeholders including government officials, industry experts, academics, and civil society representatives, will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the AI Safety Framework and ensuring that it remains aligned with Nepal's national interests. The Byzantine fault tolerance model ensures that the council can continue to function effectively even in the presence of a certain number of faulty or malicious actors, providing a high degree of resilience and trustworthiness.

Our **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** provides a structured and iterative approach to AI governance. This methodology, based on the well-established Deming Cycle, enables organizations to continuously improve their AI safety and compliance processes. The SOAI-PDCA cycle involves four stages: planning for AI safety, implementing the plan, checking the effectiveness of the implementation, and acting on the results to make necessary adjustments. This iterative approach ensures that AI governance remains a dynamic and evolving process, capable of adapting to the ever-changing technological landscape.

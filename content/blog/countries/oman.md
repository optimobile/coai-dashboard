# AI Safety Framework for Oman: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Oman is at a critical juncture in its technological evolution. With the rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the approaching EU AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, the urgency for a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been more pronounced. The Sultanate's proactive stance on digital transformation, as evidenced by the “National Program for Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Digital Technologies,” provides a solid foundation. However, without a robust governance structure, Oman risks falling behind, exposing its citizens and businesses to the multifaceted risks of unregulated AI. This is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to ensure that AI development aligns with national values, fosters innovation responsibly, and secures a competitive edge in the global digital economy. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a tailored, white-label solution to bridge this gap, empowering Oman to build a future-proof AI ecosystem that is safe, ethical, and prosperous.

## Current State of AI in Oman

Oman has embarked on an ambitious journey of digital transformation, with AI at its core. The government's “National Program for Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Digital Technologies (2024–2026)” underscores a national commitment to leveraging AI for economic and developmental growth. This program aims to position Oman among the top 50 countries in the Government AI Readiness Index, a testament to its forward-thinking vision. AI adoption is steadily gaining momentum across various sectors, with pilot projects launched in healthcare, justice, public procurement, and education. These initiatives are designed to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and service delivery, reflecting a strategic approach to integrating AI into the fabric of Omani society.

The key industries spearheading AI adoption in Oman include the energy sector, where AI is used for optimizing exploration and production; the financial sector, with the Central Bank of Oman encouraging the use of machine learning for fraud detection and credit scoring; and the logistics sector, a cornerstone of Oman's economic diversification strategy. The government's digital transformation initiatives, such as the establishment of a National Open Data Platform and a National Center for AI Research and Development, are creating a fertile ground for AI innovation. While Oman has made significant strides in embracing AI, the existing technology regulations are still nascent, highlighting the need for a comprehensive governance framework to guide the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its commendable progress in AI adoption, Oman is one of 118 countries that currently lack a comprehensive AI governance framework. This governance gap poses significant risks to the nation's long-term digital ambitions. Without clear regulatory guardrails, the development and deployment of AI systems can lead to unintended consequences, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and a lack of accountability. For citizens, this could translate into discriminatory outcomes in areas such as employment and access to financial services, eroding public trust in AI. For businesses, the absence of a clear legal and ethical framework creates uncertainty, stifles innovation, and exposes them to potential reputational and financial risks.

The lack of a national AI safety framework also puts Omani businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global market. As countries around the world, particularly in the European Union, move towards stricter AI regulations, Omani companies may face barriers to entry if their AI systems do not meet international standards. The EU AI Act, with its fast-approaching deadline, will have extraterritorial reach, impacting any organization that offers AI systems to the EU market. Therefore, the absence of a proactive AI governance strategy not only jeopardizes the safety and well-being of Omani citizens but also hinders the nation's ability to fully capitalize on the economic opportunities presented by the AI revolution.

## CSOAI's Solution for Oman

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to address Oman's specific needs and challenges. Our solution is not a one-size-fits-all approach but a customizable framework that can be seamlessly integrated into Oman's existing digital transformation strategy. At the heart of our offering is the CEASAI Certification, a professional qualification for AI safety analysts, which will empower the local workforce with the skills needed to navigate the complexities of AI governance. We propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council, a decentralized and resilient oversight body composed of local experts, to ensure that AI systems are aligned with Oman's cultural and ethical values.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI governance, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation to the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This methodology, inspired by international best practices, will help Omani organizations to build, deploy, and manage AI systems in a way that is transparent, accountable, and safe. By partnering with CSOAI, Oman can not only bridge its AI governance gap but also position itself as a regional leader in responsible AI innovation. Our solution is designed to be implemented in a phased manner, ensuring a smooth and effective transition towards a mature and robust AI governance ecosystem.

## Implementation Roadmap

Our proposed implementation roadmap is designed to be both ambitious and achievable, enabling Oman to establish a fully operational AI safety framework in a timely manner.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

During this initial phase, we will work closely with Omani stakeholders to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current AI landscape, identify specific risks and opportunities, and develop a tailored AI safety framework that aligns with the nation's strategic objectives. This will involve a series of workshops, consultations, and knowledge-sharing sessions with government agencies, industry leaders, and academic institutions.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In the second phase, we will focus on the deployment of the AI safety framework, including the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the rollout of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. We will provide hands-on support to Omani organizations to help them integrate the framework into their existing processes and workflows.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

This phase will run in parallel with the framework deployment and will focus on building local capacity through the training and certification of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts. The CEASAI certification program will equip these professionals with the skills and knowledge needed to ensure the ongoing safety and compliance of AI systems across the country.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

By the end of the implementation program, Oman will have a fully operational AI safety framework, a cadre of certified AI safety professionals, and a robust governance structure to oversee the responsible development and deployment of AI. This will not only mitigate the risks associated with AI but also unlock new opportunities for innovation and growth.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of our commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, CSOAI is proud to announce a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will provide free access to our CEASAI certification program for 500,250 analysts worldwide, including a significant allocation for Omani citizens. This is a unique opportunity for Oman to rapidly build its domestic AI safety capacity at no cost. The CEASAI certification is a globally recognized qualification that will equip Omani professionals with the skills to design, develop, and deploy safe and ethical AI systems. By taking advantage of this giveaway, Oman can create a pipeline of talent that will be instrumental in driving the nation's AI ambitions forward. This is not just about training individuals; it is about building a sustainable ecosystem of expertise that will ensure the long-term success of Oman's AI journey.

# AI Safety Framework for Burkina Faso: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Burkina Faso is at a critical juncture in its digital transformation journey. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the nation faces an urgent need to establish a robust AI safety framework. The absence of such a framework not only poses significant risks to citizens and businesses but also threatens to leave Burkina Faso behind in the global digital economy. A national AI safety framework is not merely a matter of compliance; it is a strategic imperative for ensuring that the development and deployment of artificial intelligence are aligned with the nation's values and developmental goals. For Burkina Faso, this is a pivotal moment to build a future where AI is a tool for inclusive growth, innovation, and social progress. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label solution to help Burkina Faso navigate this complex landscape, providing the necessary tools, training, and expertise to build a sovereign and responsible AI ecosystem.

## The Current State of AI in Burkina Faso

Burkina Faso is in the early stages of a digital revolution, with the government actively promoting digital transformation and the adoption of artificial intelligence. The nation's leadership has recognized the transformative potential of AI and has initiated several programs to integrate this technology across various sectors. The government's commitment is underscored by the development of a national AI Action Plan for 2026-2028 and the launch of a nationwide awareness campaign to promote digital sovereignty and responsible AI adoption. These initiatives aim to create a fertile ground for AI-driven innovation and to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared by all citizens.

Key industries in Burkina Faso are beginning to explore the applications of AI, particularly in agriculture, healthcare, and education. In agriculture, which is the backbone of the nation's economy, AI is being used for crop monitoring, disease detection, and optimizing yields. For instance, drones equipped with AI-powered cameras are helping farmers to identify and address pest infestations more effectively. In the healthcare sector, AI is being explored for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and public health management. The education sector is also poised to benefit from AI, with potential applications in personalized learning, educational resource development, and administrative efficiency. Furthermore, the national broadcaster is partnering to use AI for inclusive communication and linguistic accessibility, demonstrating a commitment to leveraging technology for social inclusion.

The government of Burkina Faso has been proactive in laying the groundwork for a digital economy. The World Bank has approved a $150 million Digital Acceleration Project to improve access to digital infrastructure, public services, and digital skills. This project, coupled with the national digital economy development plan (2018-2027), provides a solid foundation for the growth of AI in the country. While specific AI regulations are still in their nascent stages, Burkina Faso has a data protection law (Law No. 001-2021) that provides a legal framework for the processing of personal data. The Regulatory Authority for Electronic Communications and Posts (ARCEP) oversees the electronic communications sector, and its role will be crucial in shaping the regulatory landscape for AI. These existing legal and regulatory frameworks, while not AI-specific, provide a starting point for developing a comprehensive AI governance structure.

## The AI Governance Gap

Burkina Faso is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks, from the perpetuation of biases in AI algorithms to the misuse of AI for malicious purposes. Without a clear set of rules and standards, there is a danger that AI could be deployed in ways that are detrimental to the rights and interests of citizens. For example, biased AI systems could lead to discrimination in areas such as employment, credit scoring, and even criminal justice. The absence of a governance framework also creates uncertainty for businesses, making it difficult for them to invest in and innovate with AI. This can stifle economic growth and prevent Burkina Faso from fully realizing the potential of the digital economy.

The lack of AI governance has a direct impact on the lives of ordinary citizens. It can lead to a loss of trust in technology and government, and it can exacerbate existing inequalities. For example, if AI-powered systems are used to make decisions about access to public services, and these systems are not transparent or accountable, it can lead to a sense of disenfranchisement and marginalization. Furthermore, the absence of a legal framework for AI makes it difficult for individuals to seek redress if they are harmed by an AI system. For businesses, the lack of a clear regulatory environment creates a climate of uncertainty, which can deter investment and innovation. It also makes it difficult for Burkinabè businesses to compete in the global marketplace, where AI is increasingly becoming a key differentiator.

## CSOAI's Solution for Burkina Faso

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Burkina Faso's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy governance structure that can be adapted to the specific needs and context of the nation. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution; rather, it is a flexible and adaptable system that can be tailored to Burkina Faso's unique legal, cultural, and economic landscape. The framework includes a set of policies, standards, and best practices for the responsible development and deployment of AI. It also provides a roadmap for establishing a national AI ethics committee, which would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the framework and ensuring that AI is used in a way that is consistent with the nation's values.

At the heart of our solution is the Certified Expert in AI Safety and Audit (CEASAI) program. This program is designed to create a local pool of certified professionals who have the skills and expertise to assess the safety and compliance of AI systems. By training and certifying local experts, we can help to build a sustainable AI ecosystem in Burkina Faso, one that is not dependent on foreign expertise. The CEASAI program covers a wide range of topics, including AI ethics, risk management, and auditing. Graduates of the program will be equipped to work in a variety of roles, from AI safety auditors to policy advisors. This will not only help to ensure the safety and reliability of AI systems but will also create new employment opportunities for the youth of Burkina Faso.

To ensure robust and independent oversight of AI systems, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council. This council would be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, academics, civil society representatives, and industry experts. The council would be responsible for reviewing and approving high-risk AI systems, as well as for investigating any incidents that may occur. The Byzantine fault tolerance model ensures that the council can continue to function effectively even if some of its members are compromised or act maliciously. This provides a high level of assurance that the council's decisions will be fair, impartial, and in the best interests of the nation.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured approach to AI safety and governance. This methodology is based on the well-established continuous improvement cycle and is designed to help organizations to systematically manage their AI risks. The SOAI-PDCA methodology involves a four-stage process: planning for AI safety, implementing AI safety controls, checking the effectiveness of those controls, and acting to improve the AI safety management system. This iterative approach ensures that organizations are constantly learning and improving their AI safety practices. It also provides a clear and auditable trail of an organization's AI safety activities, which can be used to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.


## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Burkina Faso. This roadmap is designed to be completed within a 24-month timeframe, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Burkina Faso's existing digital infrastructure, legal and regulatory landscape, and human capital. This will be followed by a series of workshops with key stakeholders to develop a customized AI Safety Framework that is aligned with the nation's priorities and goals. The output of this phase will be a detailed implementation plan, including a budget, timeline, and a set of key performance indicators.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

The second phase will focus on the deployment of the AI Safety Framework. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, the development of a national AI ethics code, and the integration of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology into government and industry workflows. During this phase, we will also launch a public awareness campaign to educate citizens about the benefits and risks of AI.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months)**

The third phase will be dedicated to building local capacity in AI safety and governance. Through our CEASAI certification program, we will train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts. These analysts will form the backbone of Burkina Faso's AI safety ecosystem, providing the expertise needed to assess, audit, and manage AI systems. The training will be delivered through a combination of online and in-person sessions, and will be tailored to the specific needs of the Burkinabè context.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (3 months)**

The final phase will involve the transition to full operational capability. This will include the handover of the AI Safety Framework to the national authorities, the establishment of a sustainable funding mechanism, and the integration of the framework into the nation's long-term digital transformation strategy. By the end of this phase, Burkina Faso will have a fully functional and self-sustaining AI governance ecosystem.

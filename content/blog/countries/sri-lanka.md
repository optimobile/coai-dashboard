# AI Safety Framework for Sri Lanka: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Sri Lanka stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence present a transformative opportunity for the nation's economy and society. However, without a robust governance framework, the country risks falling behind and exposing its citizens and businesses to significant risks. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Sri Lanka to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework is now. This is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to foster innovation, attract investment, and ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution for Sri Lanka to bridge this governance gap, providing a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a proven methodology for compliance. This proposal outlines a clear roadmap for Sri Lanka to become a leader in AI governance, creating a secure and prosperous digital future for all its citizens.

## Current State of AI in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka's journey with Artificial Intelligence is a study in contrasts. While the nation's AI adoption rate of 6.2% places it in the lower tier of global economies, it simultaneously leads the South Asian region in AI-related job growth. This paradoxical situation highlights both the challenges and the immense potential for AI in the country. In 2025, an impressive 7.3% of all white-collar job postings in Sri Lanka were AI-related, and the country ranks second in the region for ChatGPT usage, signaling a strong and growing interest in AI technologies among its workforce and populace.

The adoption of AI is most prominent in key sectors such as finance, telecommunications, and information technology. Financial institutions are leveraging AI for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized customer services. In the telecommunications sector, AI is being used to optimize network performance and enhance customer support. The burgeoning startup ecosystem in Sri Lanka is also embracing AI, with innovative companies in fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, and agriculture using AI to build transformative solutions.

The Sri Lankan government has demonstrated a clear commitment to digital transformation. The formulation of a National Strategy on AI and the National Digital Economy Strategy 2030 underscores the government's vision to harness the power of technology for economic growth and societal development. These strategies aim to position Sri Lanka as a regional hub for AI development, testing, and scaling. Further bolstering these initiatives is a recent $50 million project approved by the World Bank to support Sri Lanka's digital transformation, with a focus on improving digital services and growing the digital economy. While a comprehensive national AI policy is yet to be enacted, existing technology regulations provide a foundation upon which a robust AI governance framework can be built.

## The AI Governance Gap

Sri Lanka is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap, while not unique to Sri Lanka, presents a significant and growing risk in a world that is rapidly embracing AI. Without a clear set of rules and regulations, the country is left vulnerable to the potential downsides of this powerful technology, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and a lack of accountability for AI-driven decisions. The absence of a national AI policy also creates uncertainty for businesses, hindering their ability to innovate and compete in the global market. For citizens, the lack of AI governance can lead to a sense of mistrust and a feeling of powerlessness in the face of opaque and unaccountable AI systems.

The risks of not having a robust AI safety framework are manifold. From an economic perspective, Sri Lanka may struggle to attract foreign investment in its technology sector, as international partners will be hesitant to engage with a country that lacks clear AI regulations. This could stifle the growth of the local AI ecosystem and prevent the country from realizing its full potential as a regional AI hub. Socially, the unregulated use of AI could exacerbate existing inequalities and create new forms of discrimination. For example, biased AI algorithms used in hiring or lending could disproportionately disadvantage certain groups of people. From a security standpoint, the absence of AI governance could open the door to malicious actors who may seek to exploit AI for criminal or disruptive purposes.

## CSOAI's Solution for Sri Lanka

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Sri Lanka's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be adapted to Sri Lanka's specific needs and cultural context. This framework is designed to be fully compliant with international standards, including the EU AI Act, ensuring that Sri Lanka can seamlessly integrate with the global digital economy.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts International) Certification program. This program is designed to create a new generation of AI safety professionals in Sri Lanka, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to oversee the development and deployment of AI systems. By training a local workforce of AI safety analysts, Sri Lanka can build the internal capacity to manage its own AI ecosystem, reducing its reliance on foreign expertise and creating high-value employment opportunities for its citizens.

To ensure robust and impartial oversight of AI, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This innovative governance model brings together a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry experts, academics, and civil society representatives, to provide a balanced and holistic approach to AI governance. The Council's structure is designed to be resilient and resistant to capture by any single interest group, ensuring that the public interest is always at the forefront of AI-related decision-making.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a practical and effective way for organizations to implement and maintain their AI safety frameworks. This iterative approach to compliance ensures that AI systems are continuously monitored, evaluated, and improved, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive approach to AI governance that can keep pace with the rapid evolution of the technology.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of a national AI safety framework in Sri Lanka. This roadmap is designed to be completed within a 24-month timeframe, with clear milestones and deliverables for each phase.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The first phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Sri Lanka's current AI landscape, including a review of existing policies, regulations, and infrastructure. This will be followed by a collaborative planning process to develop a customized AI safety framework that is tailored to Sri Lanka's specific needs and priorities.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

Once the framework has been finalized, the second phase will focus on its deployment across the public and private sectors. This will involve the development of implementation guidelines, the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, and the launch of a public awareness campaign to educate citizens and businesses about the new AI governance framework.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts (12 months)**

The third phase will be dedicated to building a local workforce of AI safety professionals. Through the CEASAI Certification program, we will train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Sri Lanka, creating a sustainable and self-sufficient AI governance ecosystem.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability (3 months)**

In the final phase, the AI safety framework will become fully operational. This will involve the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the framework, the continuous improvement of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology, and the regular review and updating of the framework to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in the face of new and emerging AI technologies.

# AI Safety Framework for Lebanon: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Lebanon stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) present a monumental opportunity for economic revitalization and societal progress. However, without a robust governance framework, the nation risks falling behind and exposing its citizens and businesses to significant threats. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Lebanon to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. This is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a manner that is safe, ethical, and aligned with Lebanon's national interests. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this governance gap, empowering Lebanon to build a resilient and competitive AI ecosystem for the future.

## Current State of AI in Lebanon

Lebanon's journey into the age of artificial intelligence is characterized by a blend of nascent adoption, entrepreneurial spirit, and significant structural challenges. Despite the ongoing economic crisis, pockets of innovation are emerging across various sectors. The country's highly educated and multilingual workforce provides a strong foundation for AI development, particularly in areas like Natural Language Processing (NLP) where Lebanon's trilingual talent (Arabic, English, French) offers a unique competitive advantage. Key industries such as banking, healthcare, and education have begun to experiment with AI applications, from fintech solutions and diagnostic tools to personalized learning platforms. The government has also signaled its intent to embrace digital transformation, with the establishment of a Ministry for AI and the formulation of a national AI strategy in collaboration with international bodies like ESCWA. However, the implementation of these initiatives has been hampered by political instability and economic constraints. The existing technology regulations are not yet equipped to handle the complexities of AI, creating a legal and ethical vacuum. While startups and academic institutions are driving the initial push, a concerted national effort, supported by a clear regulatory framework, is essential to unlock Lebanon's full AI potential.

## The AI Governance Gap

Lebanon is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This absence of regulation creates a high-risk environment, leaving the nation vulnerable to a range of threats. Without clear ethical guidelines and legal standards, the deployment of AI systems can lead to privacy violations, algorithmic bias, and a lack of accountability. For a society as diverse as Lebanon, the risk of AI-perpetuating or even amplifying existing social and sectarian divisions is a serious concern. Businesses, both local and international, are hesitant to invest in a market that lacks regulatory certainty, stifling innovation and economic growth. Citizens, in turn, are left with little to no recourse in the event of AI-related harm. The AI governance gap not only exposes Lebanon to internal risks but also isolates it from the global digital economy. As leading nations and economic blocs like the EU move towards comprehensive AI regulation, countries without comparable frameworks will face significant barriers to trade and collaboration. The lack of a sovereign AI strategy also opens the door for foreign-developed AI systems to be deployed without adequate oversight, potentially compromising national security and data sovereignty.

## CSOAI's Solution for Lebanon

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) provides a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework designed to be adapted and deployed by national governments. For Lebanon, this offers a fast-track solution to establishing a world-class AI governance regime. The framework is built on a three-tiered approach:

1.  **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** This decentralized governance model ensures robust and resilient oversight of the national AI ecosystem. The council is comprised of 33 independent agents, including representatives from government, industry, academia, and civil society. This distributed structure prevents any single point of failure and ensures that a diverse range of perspectives are brought to the decision-making process.

2.  **CEASAI Certification:** The Certified Expert in AI Safety and Audit (CEASAI) program is a professional certification designed to build local capacity in AI safety and governance. By training a cadre of local experts, Lebanon can ensure that it has the in-house talent to implement and manage its national AI framework.

3.  **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** The Safety-Oriented AI Plan-Do-Check-Act (SOAI-PDCA) methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to AI compliance. This ensures that AI systems are developed and deployed in a manner that is continuously monitored, evaluated, and improved.

This integrated solution empowers Lebanon to not only meet international standards but also to build a sovereign AI governance capability that is tailored to its unique national context.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phased implementation roadmap to guide Lebanon's journey towards full AI operational capability:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This initial phase involves a comprehensive assessment of Lebanon's existing AI landscape, legal framework, and institutional capacity. Working in close collaboration with Lebanese stakeholders, CSOAI will develop a detailed and customized implementation plan.

*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, the white-label AI Safety Framework will be adapted and deployed. This includes the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council and the integration of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology into the national regulatory framework.

*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** This phase focuses on building local capacity through the CEASAI certification program. The goal is to train and certify at least 1,000 Lebanese AI Safety Analysts who will form the backbone of the country's AI governance workforce.

*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In the final phase, the national AI safety framework becomes fully operational. The Byzantine Council assumes its oversight responsibilities, and the certified AI Safety Analysts are deployed across the public and private sectors to ensure compliance.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

As part of its global mission to promote AI safety, CSOAI is offering a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative provides free access to the CEASAI certification program for citizens of the 118 countries that currently lack AI governance, including Lebanon. With a global target of training 500,250 analysts, this program represents a monumental investment in building global AI safety capacity. For Lebanon, this is an unprecedented opportunity to upskill its workforce and create a new generation of AI professionals at no cost. The immediate availability of a large pool of certified AI safety experts will enable Lebanon to rapidly deploy its national AI framework and attract international investment.

# AI Safety Framework for Belize: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Belize to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been more critical. The EU AI Act will have extraterritorial effects, impacting any entity that offers AI systems or services to EU citizens, regardless of where the entity is based. For Belize, a nation poised for digital transformation, the absence of a national AI governance framework creates significant risks, including potential trade barriers with the EU, diminished competitiveness for local businesses, and a lack of trust in AI technologies among its citizens. Proactive adoption of a robust AI safety framework will not only mitigate these risks but also position Belize as a forward-thinking leader in the Caribbean, ready to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence for economic growth and social development. This is a pivotal moment for Belize to build a future-proof digital ecosystem grounded in safety, ethics, and trust.

## Current State of AI in Belize

Belize is at a nascent but promising stage of AI adoption, with the government and private sector beginning to explore the potential of this transformative technology. The country's digital journey is guided by the **National Digital Agenda 2022-2025**, a comprehensive strategy aimed at fostering a digital government and society. This agenda emphasizes the importance of digital infrastructure, e-services, and digital skills, creating a fertile ground for AI to flourish. Key industries are already starting to leverage AI. The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector, a significant employer in Belize, is exploring AI-powered solutions to enhance efficiency and service delivery. In agriculture, AI is being used for crop monitoring and yield optimization, helping to improve food security and export competitiveness. The tourism industry, a cornerstone of Belize's economy, is also beginning to use AI for personalized marketing and customer service.

In terms of regulation, Belize has already taken important steps to create a secure digital environment. The **Data Protection Act of 2021** provides a framework for the lawful, fair, and transparent processing of personal data, aligning with international best practices. This is complemented by the **Cybercrime Act of 2020**, which provides law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat online criminal activities. However, despite these foundational regulations, a specific governance framework for AI is conspicuously absent. This "AI governance gap" leaves Belize vulnerable to the unique challenges posed by AI, such as algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, and accountability issues. Without a dedicated framework, Belize risks falling behind in the global digital economy and failing to protect its citizens from the potential harms of unregulated AI.

## The AI Governance Gap

Belize is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This gap is not just a matter of policy but a significant impediment to the nation's digital aspirations. The absence of a clear regulatory landscape for AI creates uncertainty for businesses, stifles innovation, and erodes public trust. The risks are manifold. Without proper oversight, AI systems could perpetuate and even amplify existing social biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas such as hiring, lending, and law enforcement. The lack of transparency in AI decision-making processes can make it difficult to hold anyone accountable when things go wrong, leaving citizens with little recourse. For businesses, the absence of a clear legal framework makes it risky to invest in and deploy AI technologies, hindering their ability to compete in the global marketplace.

The impact on citizens and businesses is profound. Citizens may be hesitant to adopt AI-powered services if they do not trust that their data will be protected and that the systems will be fair and reliable. This could limit the uptake of beneficial AI applications in areas such as healthcare and education. For businesses, the lack of a clear regulatory framework creates a competitive disadvantage. They may be unable to access international markets that require compliance with AI safety standards, such as the EU. Furthermore, the absence of a national AI strategy means that Belize may miss out on the opportunity to develop a domestic AI industry, creating high-skilled jobs and driving economic growth.

## CSOAI's Solution for Belize

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to Belize's specific needs and priorities. This is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable framework that can be integrated with Belize's existing legal and regulatory landscape. The framework is built on the principles of safety, transparency, fairness, and accountability, and it provides a clear roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.

At the heart of our solution is the **CEASAI Certification**, a professional certification for AI safety analysts. This program is designed to build local capacity and create a pipeline of skilled professionals who can design, implement, and audit AI safety frameworks. By training a cadre of local experts, Belize can ensure that its AI governance framework is not only compliant with international standards but also responsive to the unique needs and values of its society.

To ensure robust oversight, we propose the establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight**. This decentralized and resilient governance model is designed to prevent single points of failure and ensure that the AI safety framework is implemented in a fair and impartial manner. The council would be composed of a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry representatives, academics, and civil society organizations.

Our **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology** provides a structured and iterative approach to AI safety. This methodology allows organizations to continuously monitor and improve their AI systems, ensuring that they remain safe, reliable, and aligned with ethical principles. The SOAI-PDCA methodology is a practical and effective tool for managing the entire lifecycle of AI systems, from design and development to deployment and decommissioning.

## Implementation Roadmap

We propose a four-phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Belize:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months):** This phase will involve a comprehensive assessment of Belize's existing digital ecosystem, including its legal and regulatory framework, infrastructure, and human capital. We will work closely with government officials, industry stakeholders, and civil society to develop a tailored implementation plan that aligns with Belize's national priorities.

*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months):** In this phase, we will deploy the white-label AI Safety Framework, customizing it to meet the specific needs of Belize. This will include the development of national AI safety standards, guidelines, and best practices.

*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts:** This phase will focus on building local capacity through the CEASAI certification program. We will train 1,000 AI safety analysts from both the public and private sectors, creating a critical mass of skilled professionals who can drive the adoption of AI safety practices across the country.

*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability:** In this final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with the 33-Agent Byzantine Council providing oversight and the SOAI-PDCA methodology being used to ensure continuous improvement. Belize will have a robust and resilient AI governance framework that is aligned with international best practices and tailored to its unique national context.

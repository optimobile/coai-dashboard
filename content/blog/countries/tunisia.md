# AI Safety Framework for Tunisia: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

With the European Union's AI Act enforcement deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Tunisia to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. As a nation making significant strides in AI adoption and digital transformation, Tunisia stands at a critical juncture. The absence of a national AI governance strategy not only poses risks to its citizens and businesses but also threatens to create a digital divide with its primary trading partner, the EU. A proactive approach to AI governance will enable Tunisia to mitigate these risks, foster innovation, and align with international standards, ensuring its digital future is both prosperous and secure. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to bridge this gap, providing a clear path for Tunisia to become a leader in responsible AI.

## The Current State of AI in Tunisia

Tunisia is actively embracing the potential of artificial intelligence, with the government and private sector both driving adoption across various industries. The nation's commitment to digital transformation is evident in its national strategies and the tangible results already being achieved. Tunisia's ranking of 85th in the Global AI Index is a testament to its progress and potential in the global AI landscape. The government's "National AI Strategy" and "National Digital Strategy 2021-2025" provide a roadmap for this transformation, with 138 projects underway to modernize public administration. A key initiative is the "Tartib 2.0" digital application, set to become mandatory in 2026, which will streamline public investment decisions.

Key industries are already reaping the benefits of AI. In the pharmaceutical sector, AI has dramatically reduced order processing times from one hour to a mere 30 seconds. The tourism industry is leveraging AI to enhance its services and attract more visitors, contributing to a significant boom in the sector. Other key areas of AI adoption include agriculture, manufacturing, education, healthcare, and fintech, where AI is being used to optimize processes, improve outcomes, and drive innovation. The Tunisian Institute for Strategic Studies (ITES) has even proposed leveraging AI to forge a "renewed social contract" and a "national collective intelligence," highlighting the transformative potential of this technology for the nation's social fabric.

Existing technology regulations provide a foundation for responsible AI development. Tunisia's Organic Act No. 2004-63 on the protection of personal data, along with constitutional protections for privacy, establishes a legal framework for data governance. Furthermore, the country's adoption of ISO 9001 standards, overseen by the National Institute for Standardization and Industrial Property (INNORPI), demonstrates a commitment to quality and international best practices. These existing regulations, combined with the government's forward-looking digital strategies, create a fertile ground for the development of a comprehensive and effective AI safety framework.

## The AI Governance Gap

Despite its forward momentum in AI adoption, Tunisia finds itself among 118 nations currently lacking a comprehensive AI-specific governance framework. This gap exists not because of a lack of technological progress, but because the rapid evolution of AI has outpaced the development of specific regulations to address its unique challenges. While Tunisia has foundational data protection and privacy laws, these are not sufficient to cover the complexities of AI systems, which can be opaque, biased, and have far-reaching societal impacts. This regulatory gap leaves the nation, its citizens, and its businesses vulnerable to a range of risks.

The absence of a dedicated AI governance framework exposes Tunisia to significant threats. Ethically, unregulated AI can perpetuate and amplify existing biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas like hiring, loan applications, and even criminal justice. Privacy is another major concern, as AI systems often require vast amounts of data, and without clear rules, this data can be misused or breached. A lack of transparency in AI decision-making can erode public trust, while inconsistent standards can stifle innovation and create a chaotic market. Economically, the lack of a clear regulatory environment creates uncertainty for businesses, and with the EU AI Act on the horizon, Tunisian companies may face significant barriers to entry into the European market, their largest trading partner.

The impact of this governance gap is felt by all segments of Tunisian society. For citizens, it can mean a loss of fundamental rights, from privacy to fair treatment. For businesses, it translates to legal and financial risks, as well as a missed opportunity to build a competitive advantage in the global digital economy. Without a clear framework, Tunisian innovators may struggle to attract investment and scale their AI solutions. In essence, the AI governance gap is not just a regulatory issue; it is a critical economic and social challenge that Tunisia must address to secure its future in the age of AI.

## CSOAI's Solution for Tunisia

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and integrated solution to address Tunisia's AI governance gap and empower the nation to build a safe and prosperous digital future. Our platform is designed to be a turnkey solution for governments and enterprises, providing the tools, training, and framework necessary for effective AI oversight and compliance. For Tunisia, CSOAI's solution is not just about mitigating risks; it's about unlocking the full potential of AI for economic growth and social progress.

At the core of our offering is a **white-label AI Safety Framework** that can be rapidly deployed and customized to meet Tunisia's specific needs. This framework provides a clear and structured approach to AI governance, covering everything from data privacy and security to algorithmic transparency and fairness. It is designed to be interoperable with international standards, including the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF, ensuring that Tunisian businesses can seamlessly integrate with the global digital economy. By adopting this framework, Tunisia can leapfrog the lengthy and complex process of developing a governance model from scratch and immediately begin implementing best practices in AI safety.

To ensure that Tunisia has the local expertise to implement and manage this framework, we offer the **CEASAI Certification** program. This comprehensive training program is designed to create a new generation of AI Safety Analysts, equipping them with the skills and knowledge to audit, monitor, and manage AI systems. The CEASAI program is accessible to individuals from all backgrounds, creating a new and inclusive career path in the digital economy. By training a local workforce of AI safety professionals, Tunisia can build a sustainable and self-reliant AI ecosystem, reducing its dependence on foreign expertise and creating high-value jobs for its citizens.

For impartial and robust AI oversight, CSOAI has developed the **33-Agent Byzantine Council**. This innovative governance model uses a decentralized network of 33 independent agents to make decisions about AI safety and compliance. This Byzantine fault-tolerant system ensures that no single entity can control the decision-making process, providing a high level of assurance against bias, corruption, and external influence. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council provides a transparent and trustworthy mechanism for resolving disputes, investigating incidents, and ensuring that AI systems are aligned with Tunisia's national values and interests.

Finally, our **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology** provides a structured and iterative approach to AI governance. Based on the well-established Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, this methodology enables organizations to continuously improve their AI safety and compliance posture. The SOAI-PDCA framework provides a clear roadmap for implementing the AI Safety Framework, from initial assessment and planning to ongoing monitoring and improvement. This systematic approach ensures that AI governance is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of adaptation and learning, enabling Tunisia to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving field of AI.

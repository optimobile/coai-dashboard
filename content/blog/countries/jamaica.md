## Current State of AI in Jamaica

Jamaica is at a pivotal moment in its technological evolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a transformative force across key sectors of its economy. The Jamaican government has signaled its strong commitment to leveraging AI for national development, viewing it as a critical driver of productivity, competitiveness, and economic growth. Prime Minister Andrew Holness has publicly emphasized the need for Jamaica to embrace AI and advanced technologies to prepare for a future where the physical and digital worlds are increasingly intertwined. This forward-looking stance is further solidified by the work of the National Artificial Intelligence Task Force, which has already put forth policy recommendations to guide the country's AI journey.

One of the most significant areas of AI adoption in Jamaica is the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry, a major contributor to the nation's GDP. For years, BPO companies have been experimenting with and integrating AI-powered solutions to enhance efficiency, automate repetitive tasks, and provide more sophisticated customer service offerings. This has not only improved the competitiveness of Jamaica's BPO sector but has also started to shift the workforce towards higher-value roles that require uniquely human skills.

The tourism and hospitality sector, another cornerstone of the Jamaican economy, is also embracing AI to enhance the visitor experience and streamline operations. AI-powered systems are being used for personalized marketing, customized travel itineraries, and 24/7 customer support through chatbots. In hospitality management, AI is helping to optimize everything from booking and room allocation to energy consumption and supply chain management.

Beyond the private sector, the Jamaican government is actively exploring the use of AI to modernize public services and improve administrative efficiency. Potential applications range from streamlining tax processing and case file management in the justice system to optimizing resource allocation in healthcare and education. In a landmark move, Jamaica has become the first Caribbean nation to formally regulate the use of AI in its courts, demonstrating a proactive approach to integrating this technology in a responsible and governed manner.

While Jamaica has yet to enact a comprehensive, standalone AI law, the country is not starting from a blank slate. Existing technology regulations and a forward-looking policy environment provide a foundation upon which a robust AI governance framework can be built. The ongoing development of a national AI strategy, as highlighted by UNESCO's Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory, indicates that Jamaica is on a clear path towards harnessing the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks.

## The AI Governance Gap

While Jamaica has made commendable strides in digital transformation and has begun to lay the groundwork for AI regulation, it currently stands among 118 countries that have not yet implemented a comprehensive, national AI governance framework. This gap, between the rapid pace of AI adoption and the development of robust oversight mechanisms, presents a series of significant risks to the nation, its citizens, and its businesses. Without a clear and enforceable framework, Jamaica is navigating the complexities of the AI era without a map, potentially exposing itself to challenges that could undermine its economic and social progress.

The absence of a national AI safety framework creates a vacuum where the potential negative impacts of AI can go unchecked. For citizens, this could mean exposure to biased algorithms in areas like credit scoring or hiring, the spread of misinformation and disinformation, and the erosion of privacy through the misuse of personal data. The lack of clear guidelines for AI developers and deployers can also lead to a trust deficit, where the public is hesitant to embrace AI-powered services, thereby limiting the technology's potential benefits.

For businesses, the AI governance gap creates uncertainty and unpredictability. Companies that are eager to innovate and leverage AI may be hesitant to invest in the absence of clear rules of the road. This can stifle innovation and put Jamaican businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. Furthermore, as international regulations like the EU AI Act come into force, Jamaican companies that handle the data of EU citizens could face significant legal and financial penalties if they are not compliant. The EU AI Act, with its fast-approaching deadline of February 2, 2026, has extraterritorial reach, meaning that any organization, regardless of its location, that processes data of EU residents in relation to offering goods or services must comply with its stringent requirements.

This regulatory ambiguity also poses a risk to Jamaica's national security and sovereignty. Without a framework to govern the use of AI in critical infrastructure, law enforcement, and defense, the country could be vulnerable to both internal and external threats. The potential for AI-powered cyberattacks, the manipulation of public opinion, and the use of autonomous systems without proper ethical guidelines are all risks that a comprehensive AI governance framework would help to mitigate.

## CSOAI's Solution for Jamaica

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to bridge Jamaica's AI governance gap and accelerate the nation's journey towards safe and responsible AI adoption. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy, best-practice solution that can be tailored to Jamaica's specific needs and regulatory context. This framework is not a one-size-fits-all model; rather, it is a flexible and adaptable system that empowers Jamaica to build its own sovereign AI governance capability, while leveraging a globally recognized and proven methodology.

At the heart of our solution is the CEASAI Certification program, a world-class training and certification initiative designed to create a new generation of AI safety professionals. Through CEASAI, Jamaican citizens can gain the skills and knowledge needed to become certified AI Safety Analysts, auditors, and ethical hackers. This program is not just about theoretical knowledge; it is a hands-on, practical training that equips individuals with the tools and techniques to assess, mitigate, and manage the risks associated with AI systems. By building a local pool of certified AI safety experts, Jamaica can reduce its reliance on foreign consultants and create a sustainable, in-country capacity for AI oversight.

To ensure robust and impartial AI governance, the CSOAI framework includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight. This innovative governance model is inspired by the principles of Byzantine Fault Tolerance, a concept from computer science that ensures the reliability of a system even when some of its components fail or act maliciously. The 33-Agent Council is a decentralized and distributed body of AI and human agents that work together to monitor and regulate the use of AI in the country. This model is designed to be resilient to capture, corruption, and undue influence, ensuring that AI governance in Jamaica is always aligned with the public interest.

Our SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology provides a structured and systematic approach to AI safety and compliance. Based on the well-established Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, this methodology enables organizations to continuously improve their AI safety posture. The SOAI-PDCA framework provides a clear and actionable roadmap for companies to assess their AI risks, implement appropriate controls, monitor their effectiveness, and take corrective action when needed. This methodology is not just about ticking boxes; it is about embedding a culture of AI safety and responsibility into the DNA of every organization.

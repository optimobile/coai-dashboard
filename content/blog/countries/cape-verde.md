## Executive Summary

Cape Verde stands at a critical juncture. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the nation must act decisively to establish a robust AI safety framework. The absence of such a framework exposes Cape Verde to significant risks, including the unchecked proliferation of biased AI systems, threats to citizen privacy, and a potential decline in international competitiveness. A proactive approach to AI governance will not only mitigate these risks but also unlock the immense potential of AI to drive economic growth, enhance public services, and create a more prosperous future for all Cape Verdeans. This is the moment for Cape Verde to demonstrate leadership and build a future-proof AI ecosystem grounded in safety, ethics, and innovation.
## Current State of AI in Cape Verde

Cape Verde is actively embracing digital transformation, with the government spearheading initiatives to modernize the nation's technological infrastructure. The recent inauguration of TechPark CV, a state-of-the-art technology hub, signals a strong commitment to fostering innovation and attracting tech companies to the archipelago. This ambitious project, supported by the African Development Bank, is poised to become a significant driver of economic growth and job creation, with a focus on developing skills in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software development. The country's digital ambitions are further underscored by its 7th place ranking among African nations in the International Monetary Fund's AI Readiness Index, a testament to its progress in developing digital infrastructure and human capital.

While AI adoption is still in its nascent stages, key sectors of the Cape Verdean economy are beginning to explore its potential. In the financial services industry, AI is being leveraged for credit risk analysis, fraud detection, and the development of personalized financial products. The construction sector is also embracing AI-powered solutions for optimizing materials management, streamlining operational planning, and improving cost forecasting. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in applying AI to the tourism and agriculture sectors, which are vital to the nation's economy. The government's "Digital Cabo Verde" project, a comprehensive strategy with over 300 planned actions, is expected to accelerate the adoption of AI across all sectors of the economy, from public administration to small and medium-sized enterprises.
## The AI Governance Gap

Cape Verde, like many other nations, finds itself in a precarious position, navigating the complexities of the digital age without a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks that could undermine its economic and social progress. The absence of clear regulations and ethical guidelines for the development and deployment of AI technologies creates a legal and ethical vacuum, exposing citizens and businesses to potential harm. Without a framework to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability, biased AI systems could perpetuate and even amplify existing social inequalities. Furthermore, the lack of robust data protection regulations in the context of AI raises serious concerns about citizen privacy and the potential for misuse of personal information.

From an economic perspective, the absence of an AI governance framework could hinder Cape Verde's ability to attract foreign investment and compete in the global digital economy. As international regulations like the EU's AI Act become the norm, countries without comparable legal frameworks may find themselves at a significant disadvantage. Businesses operating in such an environment face uncertainty and potential legal challenges, which can stifle innovation and discourage investment. Moreover, the lack of a clear governance structure can lead to a fragmented and uncoordinated approach to AI development, resulting in duplicated efforts and missed opportunities for collaboration and synergy.
## CSOAI's Solution for Cape Verde

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive and customizable solution to address Cape Verde's AI governance gap. Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a ready-to-deploy set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be adapted to the specific needs and cultural context of Cape Verde. This framework is designed to be fully compliant with international standards, including the EU AI Act, ensuring that Cape Verde can seamlessly integrate into the global digital economy.

At the heart of our solution is the Certified Expert in AI Safety and Auditing (CEASAI) program. This intensive training and certification program is designed to create a new generation of AI safety professionals in Cape Verde. By equipping local talent with the skills and knowledge to audit, assess, and manage AI systems, we empower the nation to build a self-sustaining AI ecosystem. The CEASAI program covers all aspects of AI safety, from technical standards and risk management to ethical considerations and legal compliance.

To ensure robust and impartial oversight, we propose the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI. This innovative governance model brings together a diverse group of stakeholders, including government officials, industry experts, academics, and civil society representatives, to provide a balanced and resilient approach to AI governance. The council's decentralized structure and consensus-based decision-making process are designed to prevent any single point of failure and ensure that all voices are heard.

Our SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology provides a structured and iterative approach to implementing and maintaining the AI Safety Framework. This proven methodology enables organizations to continuously monitor, evaluate, and improve their AI systems, ensuring that they remain safe, reliable, and aligned with ethical principles. The SOAI-PDCA cycle provides a clear roadmap for achieving and maintaining compliance with both national and international AI regulations.
## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a phased approach to the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Cape Verde, ensuring a smooth and effective transition to a new era of AI governance.

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**

The initial phase will focus on a comprehensive assessment of Cape Verde's existing digital infrastructure, legal landscape, and human capital. This will involve close collaboration with government agencies, private sector stakeholders, and academic institutions to identify key priorities, challenges, and opportunities. The outcome of this phase will be a detailed roadmap for the implementation of the AI Safety Framework, tailored to the specific needs of Cape Verde.

**Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**

In the second phase, the white-label AI Safety Framework will be customized and deployed across all relevant government agencies and key private sector organizations. This will involve the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI and the integration of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology into existing workflows and processes.

**Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**

The third phase will focus on building local capacity through the training and certification of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts. The CEASAI program will be delivered through a combination of online and in-person training, ensuring that a large and diverse pool of talent is created across the country.

**Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**

The final phase will see the AI Safety Framework become fully operational, with all relevant organizations and individuals trained and equipped to manage the risks and opportunities of AI. The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI will be fully functional, providing ongoing oversight and guidance to ensure that Cape Verde remains at the forefront of AI governance.

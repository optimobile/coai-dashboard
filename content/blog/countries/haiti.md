# AI Safety Framework for Haiti: Building Tomorrow's AI Governance Today

## Executive Summary

Haiti stands at a critical juncture. The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a unique opportunity for national development, but it also carries significant risks without a robust governance framework. With the EU AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the time for Haiti to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework is now. This is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative to ensure that AI is adopted in a safe, ethical, and beneficial manner for all Haitians. A proactive approach to AI governance will enable Haiti to harness the full potential of AI for economic growth and social progress while mitigating the risks of misuse and unintended consequences. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a turnkey solution to help Haiti build this framework and secure its digital future.

## Current State of AI in Haiti

AI adoption in Haiti is still in its nascent stages, but there are promising signs of growth and innovation. The Haitian government, with the support of international partners like the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), has initiated digital transformation projects aimed at improving public services and fostering economic development. The IDB's "Program to create digital opportunities in Haiti through AI (ProAI)" is a notable initiative with a funding of USD 300,000 to accelerate AI adoption by training professionals and supporting businesses.

In the private sector, AI is being explored in key industries such as fintech, manufacturing, and education. A tech bootcamp, Akademi, in partnership with Quisqueya University, is at the forefront of this movement, training young Haitians in data science and AI. Graduates from this program have developed innovative AI-powered solutions to address local challenges, including a breast cancer detection tool and a model to predict food insecurity risks. [2] These initiatives demonstrate the potential of Haiti's youth to drive technological innovation and create a vibrant AI ecosystem.

However, the lack of a formal national AI strategy and the significant digital divide remain major challenges. While there are pockets of innovation, the overall AI landscape is fragmented. Existing technology regulations are not specifically tailored to address the unique challenges posed by AI, creating a governance gap that needs to be filled.

## The AI Governance Gap

Haiti is one of 118 countries that have yet to establish a formal AI governance framework. This gap leaves the nation vulnerable to a range of risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy breaches, and the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes. Without a clear regulatory framework, citizens and businesses lack the necessary protections and guidance to navigate the complexities of the digital age.

The absence of AI governance can have a profound impact on Haitian society. For citizens, it can mean a lack of recourse in cases of algorithmic discrimination or the misuse of their personal data. For businesses, it creates uncertainty and stifles innovation, as they are forced to operate in a legal vacuum. Furthermore, the lack of a national AI strategy can hinder Haiti's ability to attract foreign investment and compete in the global digital economy.

## CSOAI's Solution for Haiti

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) offers a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be customized to meet Haiti's specific needs. Our solution is designed to be implemented quickly and efficiently, providing a clear path to AI governance.

Our framework is built on four key pillars:

1.  **White-label AI Safety Framework**: A ready-to-use framework that can be adapted to Haiti's legal and cultural context.
2.  **CEASAI Certification**: A professional certification program for AI safety analysts, enabling Haiti to build a local pool of experts.
3.  **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight**: A decentralized governance model that ensures transparency, accountability, and resilience.
4.  **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology**: A Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle for continuous improvement and adaptation of the AI safety framework.

By adopting CSOAI's solution, Haiti can leapfrog the lengthy and complex process of developing an AI governance framework from scratch. Our solution provides a clear roadmap for building a safe and ethical AI ecosystem that will benefit all Haitians.

## Implementation Roadmap

CSOAI proposes a four-phased approach to implementing the AI Safety Framework in Haiti:

*   **Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (3 months)**: In this phase, we will work with Haitian stakeholders to assess the current state of AI in the country and develop a customized implementation plan.
*   **Phase 2: Framework Deployment (6 months)**: This phase will involve the deployment of the AI Safety Framework, including the establishment of the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight.
*   **Phase 3: Training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts**: We will train 1,000 Haitian professionals to become certified AI Safety Analysts (CEASAI), creating a local talent pool to support the long-term sustainability of the framework.
*   **Phase 4: Full Operational Capability**: In this final phase, the AI Safety Framework will be fully operational, with the 33-Agent Byzantine Council providing ongoing oversight and guidance.

## The £1 Billion Training Giveaway

CSOAI is committed to democratizing access to AI education and creating a global community of AI safety experts. As part of our £1 billion training giveaway, we are offering free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including citizens of Haiti. This initiative will create immediate capacity in Haiti, enabling the country to build a skilled workforce that can drive the adoption of safe and ethical AI.

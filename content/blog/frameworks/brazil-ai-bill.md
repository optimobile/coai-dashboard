# The Complete Guide to Brazil AI Bill: Everything You Need to Know for 2026 Compliance

## Executive Summary

Brazil is poised to become a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) regulation with the introduction of its comprehensive AI Bill (No. 2,338/2023). This landmark legislation, approved by the Brazilian Senate in December 2024, establishes a robust framework for the development, implementation, and use of AI systems in the country. The bill is currently under review by the Chamber of Deputies before it can be signed into law by the President. With a one-year grace period for adaptation after its enactment, organizations have a critical window to prepare for compliance by 2026.

The Brazil AI Bill is significant for global AI governance as it aligns with international best practices, particularly the risk-based approach of the European Union's AI Act. It categorizes AI systems into excessive risk (prohibited), high-risk (subject to stringent requirements), and other systems (with basic transparency obligations). This tiered approach ensures that regulatory oversight is proportional to the potential for harm, fostering innovation while safeguarding fundamental rights.

Key deadlines are tied to the bill's final approval and publication. Once enacted, organizations will have one year to bring their AI systems and practices into compliance. The legislation applies to any organization, public or private, that develops, deploys, or uses AI systems in Brazil, regardless of where the company is based. This broad territorial scope means that any global company with operations or customers in Brazil must adhere to the new regulations. The enforcement of the Brazil AI Bill will be overseen by a new national authority, with the power to levy substantial fines for non-compliance, reaching up to BRL 50 million (approximately USD 10 million) or 2% of the company's turnover in Brazil.

## Historical Context

The development of the Brazil AI Bill has been a multi-year effort, reflecting a growing global consensus on the need for responsible AI governance. The legislative journey began in February 2022, when Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco convened a committee of legal experts to draft a foundational text for AI regulation. This initiative was driven by the rapid advancements in AI technology and the increasing recognition of its potential societal impacts, both positive and negative. The committee's work culminated in a report delivered in December 2022, which recommended a risk-based regulatory framework.

This recommendation formed the basis of Senate Bill No. 2,338/2023, formally proposed by Senator Pacheco in May 2023. To ensure a thorough and inclusive legislative process, a temporary commission on artificial intelligence was established. Over 19 months, the commission conducted 24 meetings and 14 public hearings, engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including academics, civil society organizations, industry representatives, and government officials. This extensive consultation process was crucial in shaping the bill and ensuring that it reflects a balanced approach to AI regulation.

The political and economic drivers behind the Brazil AI Bill are multifaceted. Brazil, as one of the largest economies in Latin America, recognizes the transformative potential of AI to drive economic growth and social development. The government's Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Plan (PBIA) for 2024-2028, titled "AI for the Good of All," outlines an ambitious vision to position the country as a global leader in AI. The AI Bill is a cornerstone of this strategy, providing the legal certainty and ethical guardrails necessary to foster a thriving and responsible AI ecosystem. Furthermore, the bill is seen as a crucial step in protecting the fundamental rights of citizens in an increasingly digital world, aligning with Brazil's strong tradition of data protection, as enshrined in its General Data Protection Law (LGPD).

## Detailed Requirements Breakdown

The Brazil AI Bill establishes a comprehensive set of requirements for the development, deployment, and use of AI systems, with a focus on risk management, transparency, and accountability. The following is a detailed breakdown of the key provisions of the bill:

### Risk Classification System

The bill adopts a risk-based approach, categorizing AI systems into three tiers:

*   **Excessive-risk AI systems:** These are systems that pose an unacceptable level of risk to fundamental rights and are therefore prohibited. Examples include AI systems that are used for social scoring by public authorities, or that employ subliminal techniques to manipulate human behavior in a harmful way.
*   **High-risk AI systems:** These are systems that have the potential to cause significant harm to individuals or society. They are subject to a range of stringent requirements, including pre-market conformity assessments, robust risk management systems, and human oversight. The bill provides a list of high-risk AI systems, which includes those used in critical infrastructure, education, employment, and law enforcement.
*   **Other AI systems:** These are systems that are not classified as excessive or high-risk. They are subject to basic transparency obligations, such as informing users that they are interacting with an AI system.

### Prohibited AI Practices

The Brazil AI Bill explicitly prohibits certain AI practices that are deemed to be a clear threat to fundamental rights. These include:

*   AI systems that use subliminal techniques to distort a person's behavior in a way that is likely to cause them or another person physical or psychological harm.
*   AI systems that exploit the vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons due to their age, physical or mental disability, in order to distort their behavior in a way that is likely to cause them or another person physical or psychological harm.
*   AI systems that are used for social scoring by public authorities.

### High-Risk AI Requirements

Providers of high-risk AI systems are subject to a range of stringent requirements, including:

*   **Risk management system:** A continuous, iterative process that is planned, implemented, and maintained throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system.
*   **Data and data governance:** High-risk AI systems must be trained, validated, and tested on high-quality datasets to minimize the risk of bias and discrimination.
*   **Technical documentation:** Detailed documentation must be drawn up before the system is placed on the market or put into service, and must be kept up-to-date.
*   **Record-keeping:** High-risk AI systems must be designed to automatically record events ("logs") while the system is in operation.
*   **Transparency and provision of information to users:** High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed in such a way as to ensure that their operation is sufficiently transparent to enable users to interpret the system's output and use it appropriately.
*   **Human oversight:** High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed in such a way that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which the AI system is in use.
*   **Accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity:** High-risk AI systems must be designed and developed in such a way that they achieve an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity throughout their lifecycle.

### Conformity Assessment Procedures

Before placing a high-risk AI system on the market, providers must conduct a conformity assessment to ensure that the system complies with the requirements of the bill. The conformity assessment can be carried out through an internal control procedure or through a third-party conformity assessment body.

## Implementation Guide

Achieving compliance with the Brazil AI Bill will require a concerted effort from organizations. The following is a step-by-step roadmap to help organizations prepare for the new regulations:

1.  **Conduct an inventory of AI systems:** The first step is to identify all of the AI systems that are currently in use or under development within the organization.
2.  **Classify AI systems by risk level:** Once an inventory of AI systems has been created, each system must be classified according to the risk-based framework of the bill.
3.  **Conduct a gap analysis:** For each high-risk AI system, a gap analysis should be conducted to identify any areas where the system does not currently meet the requirements of the bill.
4.  **Develop a remediation plan:** Based on the results of the gap analysis, a remediation plan should be developed to address any identified gaps.
5.  **Implement the remediation plan:** The remediation plan should be implemented in a timely and effective manner.
6.  **Establish a governance framework:** Organizations should establish a comprehensive governance framework for AI, including policies, procedures, and roles and responsibilities.
7.  **Provide training to employees:** All employees who are involved in the development, deployment, or use of AI systems should receive training on the requirements of the bill.

## Penalties and Enforcement

The Brazil AI Bill establishes a robust enforcement regime to ensure compliance with its provisions. The bill designates a new national authority to oversee the implementation and enforcement of the law. This authority will have the power to conduct investigations, issue fines, and order the suspension or prohibition of non-compliant AI systems.

Penalties for non-compliance are significant, with fines of up to BRL 50 million (approximately USD 10 million) or 2% of the company's turnover in Brazil, whichever is higher. The bill also provides for a range of other penalties, including warnings, corrective measures, and the publication of the infringement.

## Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Offers Eritrea a Lifeline to Bridge the AI Governance Gap Ahead of EU AI Act Deadline**

**ASMARA, Eritrea – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a comprehensive proposal to assist Eritrea in establishing a national AI safety framework. The initiative comes as the deadline for compliance with the European Union's AI Act in February 2026 approaches, creating a sense of urgency for countries without a regulatory framework for artificial intelligence.

Eritrea is one of 118 countries that currently lack a dedicated AI governance framework, exposing it to significant economic and social risks. CSOAI's proposal includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, the establishment of a decentralized AI oversight body, and a massive training program to certify 1,000 Eritrean citizens as AI Safety Analysts.

"Eritrea has a unique opportunity to build its digital future on a foundation of safety, ethics, and trust," said [Your Name], [Your Title] at CSOAI. "Our framework is not just about compliance; it's about empowering Eritrea to harness the full potential of AI for its economic and social development."

CSOAI's initiative is supported by a £1 billion global training giveaway, which will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals worldwide, including 1,000 in Eritrea. This program is designed to create a skilled workforce to manage the country's AI ecosystem and ensure its alignment with international standards.

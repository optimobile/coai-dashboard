# Press Kit: AI Safety Framework for Lesotho

## Press Release Template

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, Lesotho] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a major initiative to support the Kingdom of Lesotho in developing a national AI safety framework. The partnership will provide Lesotho with a comprehensive, white-label AI governance solution, as well as free training for 1,000 Basotho professionals to become certified AI Safety Analysts.

The announcement comes as the deadline for compliance with the European Union’s AI Act approaches. The Act, which sets a new global standard for AI regulation, will have far-reaching implications for countries that trade with the EU. By proactively developing its own AI safety framework, Lesotho can ensure that its businesses remain competitive in the global market while protecting its citizens from the potential risks of unregulated AI.

“We are thrilled to partner with the government and people of Lesotho to build a safe and prosperous AI future for the nation,” said [Name], CEO of CSOAI. “Our AI Safety Framework provides a proven and effective solution for countries that are looking to harness the power of AI while mitigating its risks. By training a new generation of AI safety experts, we are empowering Lesotho to take control of its own AI destiny.”

The CSOAI’s AI Safety Framework is a comprehensive and customizable solution that can be adapted to the specific needs and context of any country. It includes a set of policies, standards, and guidelines for the responsible development and deployment of AI, as well as a novel 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight.

The free training for 1,000 AI Safety Analysts will be delivered through a combination of online courses, workshops, and hands-on projects. The program is open to individuals from all backgrounds and disciplines, and no prior experience in AI is required.

“This is a historic opportunity for Lesotho to become a leader in responsible AI adoption in Africa,” said [Name], Minister of Information, Communications, Science, Technology, and Innovation. “We are grateful to the CSOAI for their generous support, and we look forward to working with them to build a safe and ethical AI ecosystem that benefits all Basotho.”

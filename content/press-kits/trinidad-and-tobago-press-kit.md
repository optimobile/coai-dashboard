**Trinidad and Tobago Partners with Council of Safe AI to Launch National AI Safety Framework**

**[CITY, Trinidad and Tobago] – [DATE]** – The Government of Trinidad and Tobago, in a landmark move to secure its digital future, today announced a strategic partnership with the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) to implement a comprehensive national AI Safety Framework. This initiative will position Trinidad and Tobago as a regional leader in responsible AI governance and innovation.

The partnership comes ahead of the European Union’s AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, and addresses the critical need for a robust governance structure to manage the opportunities and risks associated with artificial intelligence. The CSOAI’s white-label framework will provide Trinidad and Tobago with a customizable, world-class solution to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a safe, ethical, and transparent manner.

As part of the initiative, the CSOAI will offer its globally recognized Certified AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) training program to citizens of Trinidad and Tobago. This program, part of a £1 billion global giveaway, will create a local workforce of certified AI safety experts, building immediate capacity for the implementation and oversight of the national framework.

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Proposes AI Safety Framework for Gabon to Foster Responsible Innovation and Economic Growth**

**[CITY, STATE, DATE]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a comprehensive proposal to assist Gabon in developing a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to position Gabon as a leader in responsible AI adoption in Africa, ensuring the nation can harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence while mitigating potential risks. The proposal comes as the global community prepares for the European Union's AI Act, which will set a new international standard for AI governance.

"Gabon has a remarkable opportunity to build a future-ready regulatory environment that fosters trust, attracts investment, and ensures that AI technologies are aligned with the nation's values and economic goals," said [CSOAI SPOKESPERSON NAME], [TITLE] at CSOAI. "Our white-label AI Safety Framework, combined with our CEASAI Certification program, provides a clear and actionable roadmap for Gabon to achieve this vision."

CSOAI's proposed solution for Gabon includes:

*   A **White-Label AI Safety Framework** that can be customized to meet Gabon's unique needs and regulatory landscape.
*   The **CEASAI Certification program**, which will train a local workforce of AI safety analysts, building in-country capacity for AI governance.
*   The **33-Agent Byzantine Council**, a novel and resilient AI oversight mechanism.
*   The **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology** to ensure the ongoing safety and effectiveness of AI systems.

As part of its commitment to global AI capacity building, CSOAI is also offering Gabonese citizens free access to its CEASAI certification program through its **£1 Billion Training Giveaway**. This initiative will provide a direct pathway for Gabonese professionals to acquire the skills needed to thrive in the AI-driven economy.

CSOAI is inviting collaboration with Gabonese government officials, business leaders, and civil society to build a safe and prosperous AI future for the nation. For more information, please visit [CSOAI WEBSITE] or contact [EMAIL ADDRESS].

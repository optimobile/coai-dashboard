**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety Framework to Nigeria**

**LAGOS, NIGERIA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global provider of AI safety and governance solutions, today announced a major initiative to support the development of a national AI safety framework in Nigeria. This move comes as the country experiences rapid growth in AI adoption across various sectors, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive regulatory and oversight structure.

“Nigeria is at a pivotal moment in its digital transformation journey,” said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “The proliferation of AI presents immense opportunities for economic development and social progress. However, without a robust safety framework, the country is exposed to significant risks, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and a loss of public trust. Our mission is to empower Nigeria with the tools and expertise to navigate the complexities of AI and build a future where innovation and safety go hand in hand.”

CSOAI’s initiative for Nigeria includes:

*   A **White-label AI Safety Framework** that can be customized to meet the country’s specific needs and regulatory requirements.
*   The **CEASAI Certification program**, which will provide free training to Nigerian professionals to become certified AI Safety Analysts, creating a sustainable local talent pool for AI governance.
*   The **33-Agent Byzantine Council**, a decentralized governance model for robust and resilient oversight of the AI ecosystem.
*   The **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology** for continuous improvement and adaptation to the evolving AI landscape.

As part of its global commitment to building AI safety capacity, CSOAI is offering a **£1 billion training giveaway**, providing free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals worldwide. A significant portion of this giveaway is allocated to Nigerian citizens, offering an unprecedented opportunity to develop high-demand skills and become leaders in the field of AI governance.

“We believe that a safe and ethical AI ecosystem is the foundation for a prosperous digital future,” added [Name]. “We are confident that by working together with our partners in Nigeria, we can build a world-class AI governance framework that will not only protect citizens but also foster innovation and position Nigeria as a leader in the global AI economy.”

## Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[City, State, Date]** - The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a groundbreaking initiative to support the development of a national AI safety framework for Somalia. This initiative, which includes a white-label AI safety framework, a comprehensive training program for local professionals, and a £1 billion global training giveaway, is designed to empower Somalia to harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) while mitigating its potential risks.

"Somalia is at a pivotal moment in its history," said [Name], [Title] of CSOAI. "With a rapidly growing digital economy and a government that is committed to embracing technology, Somalia has a unique opportunity to become a leader in responsible AI innovation. Our goal is to provide the Somali people with the tools and expertise they need to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous digital future."

CSOAI's solution for Somalia is built on four key pillars:

*   **A white-label AI Safety Framework:** A ready-to-deploy, comprehensive set of policies, standards, and best practices that can be customized and branded as Somalia's own national AI governance framework.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A globally recognized training and certification program that will create a new generation of Somali AI safety professionals.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** An innovative governance structure that will provide robust and impartial oversight of the AI ecosystem.
*   **The SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A continuous improvement cycle that will help organizations to systematically manage their AI risks and obligations.

To kickstart the development of a skilled AI workforce in Somalia, CSOAI is also offering free access to its prestigious CEASAI certification program through a £1 billion global training giveaway. This will provide 500,250 aspiring AI safety analysts worldwide, including in Somalia, with the opportunity to gain a globally recognized qualification in AI safety.

"We believe that by investing in human capital, we can help Somalia to build a brighter, more prosperous future," said [Name]. "We are confident that this initiative will not only help to ensure the safe and ethical development of AI in Somalia but also create thousands of new, high-value jobs."

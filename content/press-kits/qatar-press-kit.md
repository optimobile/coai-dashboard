**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Qatar**

**DOHA, QATAR – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a global leader in AI safety and governance solutions, today announced a proposal to partner with the State of Qatar to develop and implement a national AI Safety Framework. The proposed framework will provide a comprehensive governance structure to ensure the safe, ethical, and responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the country, in line with Qatar National Vision 2030 and the Digital Agenda 2030.

“Qatar has demonstrated a strong commitment to becoming a regional and global leader in AI, and we believe that a robust AI safety framework is essential to achieving this goal,” said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our proposed framework will not only help Qatar mitigate the risks associated with AI but also unlock its full potential to drive economic growth, enhance public services, and create a prosperous future for all.”

The proposed AI Safety Framework is a turnkey solution that includes a white-label governance platform, a professional certification program for AI safety analysts (CEASAI), and an independent oversight body, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council. The framework is built on CSOAI’s proprietary SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, which provides a structured approach to managing AI risks and ensuring continuous improvement.

As part of its proposal, CSOAI is offering to train 1,000 Qatari professionals as CEASAI-certified AI Safety Analysts, creating a sustainable local capacity for AI governance. This initiative is part of CSOAI’s £1 billion global training giveaway, which aims to train over 500,000 AI Safety Analysts worldwide.

“We are confident that our proposed AI Safety Framework will provide Qatar with the tools and expertise it needs to build a world-class AI governance ecosystem,” added [Name]. “We look forward to working with our partners in Qatar to build a safe and prosperous AI future for the nation.”

**CSOAI Offers Cambodia a Lifeline to a Safe AI Future with a White-Label AI Safety Framework and a £1 Billion Training Giveaway**

**PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a comprehensive proposal to help Cambodia build a safe and prosperous AI future. The proposal includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, a professional certification program for local AI safety analysts, and a £1 billion training giveaway.

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the urgency for Cambodia to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework has never been greater. The CSOAI's proposal provides a turnkey solution that can be tailored to Cambodia's specific needs and challenges.

"Cambodia is at a critical juncture," said [CSOAI spokesperson]. "The country has the potential to become a leader in safe and ethical AI, but it needs a robust governance framework to guide its journey. Our proposal provides that framework, along with the training and support needed to make it a success."

The CSOAI's proposal includes:

*   A white-label AI Safety Framework, complete with a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for oversight and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.
*   The CEASAI Certification, a professional qualification for local AI safety analysts.
*   A £1 billion training giveaway, which will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including a significant number of places for Cambodian citizens.

The CSOAI is inviting Cambodian government officials, business leaders, and civil society organizations to partner with them in building a safe and prosperous AI future for Cambodia.

**Guyana Partners with CSOAI to Launch National AI Safety Framework**

**GEORGETOWN, Guyana – [Date]** – The Government of Guyana today announced a landmark partnership with the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) to develop and implement a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative will position Guyana as a regional leader in responsible AI governance and prepare the nation for the opportunities and challenges of the AI-powered economy.

The partnership comes as the global community prepares for the implementation of the European Union's AI Act in 2026. By proactively establishing a comprehensive AI governance structure, Guyana aims to attract investment, foster innovation, and ensure that AI is developed and used in a safe, ethical, and equitable manner.

“The Government of Guyana is committed to harnessing the power of AI to drive economic growth and improve the lives of our citizens,” said [Name and Title of Government Official]. “This partnership with CSOAI will provide us with the tools and expertise we need to build a world-class AI governance framework that protects our values and promotes our national interests.”

CSOAI’s white-label AI Safety Framework provides a clear and actionable path for Guyana to not only meet international standards but also to position itself as a leader in responsible AI adoption within the Caribbean. The framework includes a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines for the development, deployment, and use of AI, as well as a professional certification program for AI safety analysts and a decentralized, multi-stakeholder body for AI oversight.

“We are honored to partner with the Government of Guyana on this important initiative,” said [Name and Title of CSOAI Representative]. “Guyana has a unique opportunity to build a safe and prosperous AI-powered future, and we are committed to helping them achieve that goal.”

As part of the partnership, CSOAI will also be offering free CEASAI certification to Guyanese citizens through its £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative will create a local pool of talent to support the implementation of the AI Safety Framework and empower Guyanese to participate in the country's growing digital economy.

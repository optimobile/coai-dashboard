# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Offers Tunisia a National AI Safety Framework to Accelerate Digital Transformation and Ensure EU AI Act Compliance**

**TUNIS, Tunisia – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic initiative to provide Tunisia with a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This solution is designed to help the nation build a robust AI governance model, accelerate its digital transformation, and ensure compliance with the upcoming European Union AI Act, which comes into full effect on February 2, 2026.

Tunisia has made significant strides in AI adoption, with the government and private sector leveraging this technology to drive innovation and efficiency across key industries. However, like many nations, Tunisia faces an AI governance gap that could expose it to economic and social risks. The CSOAI framework provides a turnkey solution to address this challenge, offering a clear path for Tunisia to become a regional leader in responsible AI.

“Tunisia is at a pivotal moment in its digital journey,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “By proactively establishing a national AI safety framework, Tunisia can not only mitigate the risks associated with AI but also unlock its full potential for economic growth and social progress. Our solution is designed to be a catalyst for this transformation, providing the tools, training, and support necessary for Tunisia to build a safe and prosperous digital future.”

CSOAI’s solution for Tunisia includes:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A customizable governance model that aligns with international standards, including the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A training program to create a local workforce of AI Safety Analysts, with a global giveaway of £1 billion in free training.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** An impartial and decentralized oversight body for AI safety and compliance.
*   **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A structured approach to continuous improvement in AI governance.

CSOAI is offering a phased implementation roadmap, starting with a comprehensive assessment of Tunisia’s AI landscape, followed by framework deployment, the training of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts, and the achievement of full operational capability within 12 months.

## Press Release Template

_FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE_

**Council of Safe AI Offers Bolivia a Lifeline to Bridge the AI Governance Gap**

**LA PAZ, BOLIVIA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a formal proposal to the Bolivian government to implement its comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to establish a national standard for AI governance in Bolivia, a country that is currently among 118 nations without such a framework. The proposal comes at a critical time, with the European Union’s AI Act set to take effect on February 2, 2026, which will have far-reaching implications for countries that do business with the EU.

“Bolivia is at a pivotal moment. The decisions it makes today regarding AI governance will have a profound impact on its economic competitiveness and the well-being of its citizens for decades to come,” said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our AI Safety Framework provides a clear and actionable roadmap for Bolivia to harness the transformative power of AI while mitigating its risks. We are not just offering a framework; we are offering a partnership to build a safe and prosperous AI future for Bolivia.”

The CSOAI’s proposal includes a comprehensive suite of solutions, including:

*   A **white-label AI Safety Framework** that can be customized to Bolivia’s specific needs and rapidly deployed.
*   The **CEASAI Certification**, a professional certification for AI safety analysts, which will be offered for free to Bolivian citizens as part of a £1 billion global training giveaway.
*   A **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**, a decentralized body of experts to provide independent oversight of the AI governance framework.
*   The **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology**, a structured approach to help organizations continuously monitor and improve their AI systems.

CSOAI’s proposal outlines a four-phase implementation plan that would see the AI Safety Framework become fully operational within a year. This would include the training of 1,000 Bolivian AI Safety Analysts, creating a local talent pool to support the long-term sustainability of the framework.

“We believe that AI safety is a shared responsibility, and we are committed to working with all stakeholders in Bolivia – government, industry, and civil society – to ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all,” added [Name].

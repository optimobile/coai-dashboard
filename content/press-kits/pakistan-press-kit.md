## Press Release Template

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, Pakistan] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic partnership with the Government of Pakistan to implement a comprehensive AI Safety Framework. This landmark initiative will position Pakistan as a global leader in responsible AI development and will create a new generation of AI safety professionals in the country.

The partnership will see the deployment of CSOAI's white-label AI Safety Framework, a turnkey solution that will be customized to meet Pakistan's unique needs. The framework is built on three core pillars: the CEASAI Certification program for AI Safety Analysts, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

"We are thrilled to partner with the Government of Pakistan on this critical initiative," said [Name], CEO of CSOAI. "Pakistan has a vibrant and growing technology sector, and we are confident that our AI Safety Framework will help to unlock its full potential. By building a robust and sustainable AI ecosystem, we can ensure that AI is used to create a better future for all Pakistanis."

The partnership will also include a significant investment in training and capacity building. CSOAI will provide free CEASAI certification to a large number of Pakistani citizens as part of its £1 billion global training giveaway. This will create a sustainable pipeline of skilled AI safety professionals and will help to establish Pakistan as a hub for AI talent.

"The Government of Pakistan is committed to harnessing the power of AI for economic growth and social development," said [Name], Minister of Information Technology and Telecom. "This partnership with CSOAI is a major step forward in our efforts to build a safe and responsible AI ecosystem. We are confident that this initiative will help us to achieve our vision of a digital Pakistan."

**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety Framework to Chad**

**N'DJAMENA, CHAD – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global provider of AI safety and compliance solutions, today announced a new initiative to help Chad develop a national AI safety framework. The announcement comes as countries around the world race to establish AI governance structures ahead of the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026.

"Chad has a unique opportunity to build a future-proof AI governance structure from the ground up," said [Name], CEO of CSOAI. "Our mission is to provide Chad with the tools and expertise it needs to navigate the complexities of AI governance and ensure that the nation's journey into the AI era is both safe and prosperous."

CSOAI is offering Chad a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be customized to the country's specific needs. The framework includes the CEASAI Certification program for AI safety analysts, a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

As part of this initiative, CSOAI is also extending its £1 billion training giveaway to Chad. This program will provide free CEASAI certification to aspiring AI safety professionals in Chad, helping to build a local talent pool of AI safety experts.

"By training a cadre of certified professionals, Chad can build the in-house expertise needed to oversee the development and deployment of AI systems," said [Name]. "This is not just about compliance; it's about empowering Chadians to build a safe and prosperous AI future for their country."

CSOAI is calling on government officials, business leaders, and civil society organizations in Chad to join in this important initiative. To learn more about the AI Safety Framework and the £1 billion training giveaway, please visit [website address].

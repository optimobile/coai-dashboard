**Vanuatu Partners with CSOAI to Launch National AI Safety Framework**

**[CITY, Country] – [Date]** – The Government of Vanuatu today announced a landmark partnership with the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) to develop and implement a national AI Safety Framework.

The partnership will see the deployment of CSOAI's white-label AI Safety Framework, a comprehensive and customizable solution that will be tailored to the specific needs and priorities of Vanuatu. The framework will provide a clear set of guidelines for the safe and ethical development and deployment of AI, covering all aspects of AI governance, from data privacy and security to algorithmic transparency and accountability.

As part of the initiative, CSOAI will also be providing free access to its CEASAI certification program for citizens of Vanuatu. This will create a skilled workforce of AI Safety Analysts who can support the long-term implementation of the national AI Safety Framework.

"We are delighted to be partnering with the Government of Vanuatu on this important initiative," said [Name of CSOAI Representative], [Title]. "Vanuatu has a unique opportunity to become a model for other nations in the Pacific, and we are committed to supporting them on this journey."

- **Data Sovereignty:** Ensuring that data collected and used by AI systems is managed in a way that respects Vanuatu's sovereignty and cultural values is a critical challenge.
- **Lack of Local Expertise:** A shortage of local AI talent and expertise could hinder the development and implementation of a national AI strategy.

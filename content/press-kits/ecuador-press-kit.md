**Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Offers Ecuador a Comprehensive AI Safety Framework to Bridge Governance Gap and Align with EU AI Act**

**QUITO, ECUADOR – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a formal proposal to partner with the government of Ecuador to implement a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to bridge the nation’s AI governance gap, foster a secure and ethical AI ecosystem, and align Ecuador with global standards, including the European Union’s AI Act, ahead of its February 2, 2026 deadline.

Ecuador is at a pivotal moment in its digital transformation. While the government has shown a strong commitment to embracing new technologies through its Digital Transformation Agenda 2022–2025, the absence of a dedicated national AI strategy presents significant risks to citizens and businesses. CSOAI’s proposed framework offers a turnkey solution to address this challenge, providing a customizable and adaptable governance model that can be seamlessly integrated into Ecuador’s existing legal and institutional structures.

“Ecuador has a unique opportunity to become a leader in ethical AI governance in Latin America,” said [CSOAI Representative Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “By taking proactive steps now, the country can build a safe and prosperous digital future for all its citizens. Our framework is designed to empower Ecuador with the tools, training, and expertise it needs to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating the risks.”

The CSOAI solution includes several key components:

*   **White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A ready-made, world-class governance model that can be customized to Ecuador’s specific needs.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A training and certification program to create a new generation of local AI Safety Analysts.
*   **33-Agent Byzantine Council:** An innovative, decentralized AI monitoring and governance system to ensure robust and resilient oversight.
*   **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A continuous improvement cycle to keep the AI safety framework effective and up-to-date.

As part of its commitment to democratizing access to AI education, CSOAI is also extending its £1 Billion Training Giveaway to the citizens of Ecuador. This initiative will provide free CEASAI certification to a significant number of Ecuadorians, creating a pool of local talent to support the implementation of the national AI safety framework.

“The CEASAI certification program will empower a new generation of Ecuadorian professionals to lead the way in AI safety and innovation,” added [CSOAI Representative Name]. “By building this local capacity, we can ensure that the benefits of AI are shared by all and that Ecuador is well-positioned to thrive in the global digital economy.”

CSOAI is inviting Ecuadorian government officials, academic institutions, civil society organizations, and private sector companies to engage in a dialogue about how to best implement this framework.

- **Talent Gap:** A shortage of skilled AI professionals and limited formal AI education programs impede innovation and implementation.

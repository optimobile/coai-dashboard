## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, Burundi] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced the launch of a comprehensive AI Safety Framework for Burundi, a groundbreaking initiative designed to build a secure and prosperous digital future for the nation. This white-label solution, which includes the globally recognized CEASAI Certification for AI safety professionals, will empower Burundi to establish robust AI governance, foster responsible innovation, and create a new generation of skilled tech professionals.

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, rapidly approaching, CSOAI's framework provides Burundi with a critical opportunity to align with international standards and position itself as a regional leader in AI safety. The framework is a turnkey solution that can be customized to meet Burundi's specific needs, providing a clear roadmap for the development, deployment, and ethical oversight of artificial intelligence.

"Our framework will not only mitigate the risks associated with AI but also unlock its immense potential for economic growth and social progress. By investing in local talent and providing a clear governance structure, we are empowering Burundi to shape its own digital destiny."

As part of this initiative, CSOAI is offering Burundian citizens free access to its CEASAI certification program through a £1 billion global training giveaway. This program will create a skilled workforce of AI Safety Analysts, providing immediate capacity for the implementation and oversight of the national AI framework.

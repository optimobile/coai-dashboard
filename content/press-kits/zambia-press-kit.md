**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Zambia to Boost Innovation and Mitigate Risks**

**[CITY, STATE, DATE]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global provider of AI safety and compliance solutions, today announced a proposal for a comprehensive national AI Safety Framework for Zambia. The proposed framework is designed to help Zambia harness the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) while mitigating the potential risks associated with the technology. The announcement comes as the deadline for compliance with the European Union’s AI Act on February 2, 2026, approaches, creating a sense of urgency for countries without a national AI strategy.

Zambia is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework, which exposes its citizens and businesses to a range of challenges, including algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and job displacement. The CSOAI’s proposed framework aims to address these challenges by providing a clear and adaptable regulatory structure for the development, deployment, and use of AI systems in the country.

“Zambia has a unique opportunity to become a leader in responsible AI adoption in Africa,” said [Name], CEO of CSOAI. “By implementing a robust AI safety framework now, the country can unlock the full potential of AI while protecting its citizens and businesses from the risks of unregulated technology.”

The CSOAI’s solution for Zambia includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, a professional certification program for local AI safety analysts (CEASAI), a decentralized AI oversight system known as the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

As part of its commitment to building global AI safety capacity, CSOAI is also offering Zambian citizens free access to its CEASAI certification program through a £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative aims to train 500,250 AI Safety Analysts worldwide, creating a global workforce of experts to ensure the safe and ethical development of AI.

“The CEASAI certification program will empower Zambian professionals with the skills they need to build and manage a safe and ethical AI ecosystem,” said [Name], Head of Certification at CSOAI. “This is a critical step in creating a sustainable digital future for the country.”

CSOAI is inviting Zambian government officials, business leaders, and civil society organizations to partner in this initiative. For more information about the proposed AI Safety Framework for Zambia, please visit [Link to CSOAI website].

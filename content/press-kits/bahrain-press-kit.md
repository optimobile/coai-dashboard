**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Offers Bahrain a Comprehensive AI Safety Framework to Foster Responsible Innovation**

**MANAMA, Bahrain – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced its proposal to provide the Kingdom of Bahrain with a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to empower Bahrain to become a regional leader in responsible AI innovation by providing the necessary tools and expertise to navigate the complexities of AI governance.

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a robust AI safety framework has become a global imperative. CSOAI's solution is designed to be rapidly deployed and customized to Bahrain's specific needs, enabling the Kingdom to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks.

"Bahrain has demonstrated a strong commitment to digital transformation, and we believe that our AI Safety Framework can help the Kingdom take the next step in its journey to becoming a leading digital economy," said [Your Name], CEO of CSOAI. "Our framework is not just about compliance; it's about building a culture of responsible innovation that will benefit all of Bahrain's citizens and businesses."

The CSOAI framework is built on four key pillars:

*   A **white-label AI Safety Framework** that can be tailored to Bahrain's legal and cultural context.
*   **CEASAI Certification**, a professional certification program for AI safety analysts.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight**, a decentralized governance model for AI.
*   **The SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology**, a structured approach to AI compliance.

As part of its commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, CSOAI is also offering a **£1 billion training giveaway**, which will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including citizens of Bahrain.

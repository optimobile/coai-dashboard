**Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Proposes National AI Safety Framework for the Philippines**

**MANILA, Philippines – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal for a comprehensive, national AI Safety Framework for the Philippines. The proposed framework aims to provide a clear roadmap for the ethical and responsible development, deployment, and governance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across the country.

The announcement comes as the Philippines, like many nations, grapples with the rapid advancements in AI and the need for a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while protecting citizens from potential risks. The CSOAI’s framework is designed to be a white-label solution that can be customized to the specific needs and priorities of the Philippines.

“The Philippines has a vibrant and growing digital economy, and AI has the potential to unlock immense opportunities for the country,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name, Title]. “However, to fully realize these benefits, it is crucial to have a robust governance framework in place. Our proposed AI Safety Framework provides a clear and actionable path for the Philippines to become a leader in AI safety and governance in the ASEAN region.”

The CSOAI’s proposal includes four key components:

*   **A white-label AI Safety Framework:** A comprehensive set of policies, standards, and best practices for AI governance.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A professional certification program to train and certify AI Safety Analysts in the Philippines.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** A decentralized and resilient governance model for AI oversight.
*   **The SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A structured and iterative approach to AI safety and compliance for organizations.

In conjunction with the framework proposal, the CSOAI is also launching a £1 billion global training initiative that will provide free access to the CEASAI certification program for 500,250 individuals worldwide, including citizens of the Philippines.

“We believe that building local capacity is essential for the successful implementation of any AI governance framework,” added [CSOAI Spokesperson Name]. “Through our training giveaway, we aim to empower Filipinos with the skills and knowledge they need to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI in their country.”

The CSOAI is calling on government officials, business leaders, and civil society organizations in the Philippines to engage in a dialogue about the proposed framework and to work together to build a safe and prosperous future with AI.

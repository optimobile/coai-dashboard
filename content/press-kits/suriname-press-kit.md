**Suriname Partners with CSOAI to Launch National AI Safety Framework**

**PARAMARIBO, Suriname – [Date]** – The Government of Suriname, in a landmark move to secure its digital future, today announced a strategic partnership with the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) to develop and implement a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative will position Suriname as a regional leader in responsible AI governance and prepare the nation for the opportunities and challenges of the AI era.

The partnership will leverage CSOAI's globally recognized expertise and comprehensive solutions to build a customized AI governance framework that aligns with international standards, including the EU's AI Act. The framework will address critical issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the ethical use of AI in both the public and private sectors.

"This is a pivotal moment for Suriname," said [Name, Title of Government Official]. "By proactively embracing AI governance, we are not only mitigating risks but also creating a trusted environment for innovation, investment, and sustainable growth. Our partnership with CSOAI will provide us with the tools and expertise we need to build a safe and prosperous AI future for all our citizens."

As part of the initiative, CSOAI will extend its £1 billion training giveaway to Suriname, offering free CEASAI certification for local professionals to become certified AI Safety Analysts. This program will rapidly build a domestic pool of experts to oversee the implementation and ongoing management of the AI framework.

"We are thrilled to partner with Suriname on this important journey," said [Name, Title at CSOAI]. "Suriname's leadership and vision in embracing AI safety will serve as a model for the Caribbean and beyond. We are committed to providing our full support to help Suriname build a world-class AI governance ecosystem."

The implementation of the AI Safety Framework will be rolled out in phases, beginning with a comprehensive assessment of Suriname's current digital landscape, followed by the deployment of the framework and the training of AI Safety Analysts.

**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Establish AI Safety Framework in Sudan**

**[CITY, STATE] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a major initiative to support Sudan in developing a national AI safety framework. This comes at a critical time as the deadline for compliance with the EU AI Act approaches in February 2026, and as 118 countries, including Sudan, currently lack any form of AI governance.

“The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence presents both immense opportunities and significant risks,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “For a nation like Sudan, establishing a robust AI safety framework is not just a matter of compliance, but a strategic imperative for national security, economic development, and the protection of its citizens. Our goal is to provide the tools and expertise necessary for Sudan to build a resilient and responsible AI ecosystem.”

CSOAI’s initiative will provide Sudan with a white-label AI Safety Framework, a customizable solution that includes a legal and technical framework for AI governance, data protection, and algorithmic accountability. The initiative also includes the CEASAI (Certified AI Safety Analyst) certification program, which will train a new generation of AI safety professionals in Sudan.

“We are also proud to announce our £1 billion training giveaway, which will provide free access to our CEASAI certification program to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including in Sudan,” added [CSOAI Spokesperson Name]. “This will create immediate capacity and empower Sudanese professionals to become leaders in the field of AI safety.”

The implementation of the AI safety framework will be guided by a four-phase roadmap, a starting with an assessment and planning phase, followed by framework deployment, the training of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts, and finally, full operational capability.

**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety and Governance Framework to Haiti**

**[City, State] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a major initiative to support Haiti in developing a national AI safety and governance framework. This move comes as the global community prepares for the implementation of the EU AI Act in February 2026, and as 118 countries, including Haiti, have yet to establish their own AI regulations.

CSOAI is offering Haiti its white-label AI Safety Framework, a comprehensive, turnkey solution designed to be quickly and effectively implemented. The framework includes the CEASAI Certification for local professionals, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

“Haiti has a unique opportunity to become a leader in the Caribbean in the field of safe and ethical AI,” said a spokesperson for CSOAI. “By adopting a robust AI governance framework now, Haiti can attract investment, foster innovation, and ensure that AI is used to benefit all its citizens.”

As part of this initiative, CSOAI is also extending its £1 billion training giveaway to Haiti, offering free CEASAI certification to aspiring AI safety analysts. This program aims to train 500,250 analysts globally, creating a skilled workforce to support the implementation of AI safety frameworks worldwide.

CSOAI is calling on Haitian government officials, business leaders, and civil society to partner in this initiative. 

**About CSOAI:**

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is a global organization dedicated to promoting the safe and ethical development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence. We provide governments and organizations with the tools and resources they need to build robust AI governance frameworks.

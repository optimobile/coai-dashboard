**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety Framework to Tanzania**

**DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a major initiative to support Tanzania in developing a national AI safety framework. This move comes as the deadline for the EU AI Act approaches in February 2026, which will have significant implications for global trade and innovation.

CSOAI will offer Tanzania its white-label AI Safety Framework, a customizable and comprehensive solution for AI governance. The framework is designed to be adapted to Tanzania's specific needs and priorities, providing a clear path to responsible AI adoption.

"Tanzania has a vibrant and growing technology ecosystem, and we are excited to partner with them to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all," said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "Our AI Safety Framework will provide the necessary guardrails for innovation, while our training programs will empower a new generation of Tanzanian AI experts."

As part of this initiative, CSOAI is also offering its CEASAI (Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation) certification program to Tanzanian citizens free of charge. This is part of a £1 billion global training giveaway to certify over 500,000 AI Safety Analysts worldwide.

"The future of AI depends on having a skilled workforce that can navigate the complexities of this technology," said [Name]. "We are committed to providing the resources and training necessary to build this workforce in Tanzania and around the world."

CSOAI's solution for Tanzania also includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight and the implementation of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

## Key Messages

### AI Challenges in Tanzania
- **Limited digital literacy and infrastructure:** While internet penetration is growing, there's still a significant digital divide, and infrastructure, especially in rural areas, needs improvement. This hinders widespread AI adoption.
- **Lack of a comprehensive legal and ethical framework:** The absence of a clear regulatory landscape for AI creates uncertainty for businesses and investors and poses risks to data privacy and algorithmic fairness.
- **Shortage of skilled AI professionals:** There is a need to develop local talent and expertise in AI to drive innovation and reduce reliance on foreign experts.
- **Data availability and quality:** High-quality, localized data is essential for training and developing effective AI models, but accessing and managing such data can be a challenge.
- **Opportunity for leapfrogging:** With the right investments in education and infrastructure, Tanzania has the opportunity to leapfrog older technologies and become a leader in AI-driven solutions for key sectors like agriculture, healthcare, and financial services.

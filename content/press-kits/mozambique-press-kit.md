**[City, State, Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal to implement a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework in Mozambique. The initiative aims to establish a robust governance structure for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the country, fostering innovation while mitigating risks. The proposed framework is designed to align with Mozambique's national development priorities and the upcoming EU AI Act deadline.

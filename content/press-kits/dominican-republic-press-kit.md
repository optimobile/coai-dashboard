**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Establish AI Safety Framework in the Dominican Republic**

**SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a new initiative to support the Dominican Republic in establishing a national AI Safety Framework. This move comes as the country experiences rapid growth in AI adoption and aims to position itself as a regional leader in responsible AI innovation.

Recent studies show that nearly 70% of the Dominican population uses AI regularly, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive governance structure to mitigate risks and ensure ethical deployment. The Dominican Republic is currently one of 118 countries without a formal AI governance framework, a gap that CSOAI’s initiative seeks to address.

“The Dominican Republic has shown immense potential in leveraging AI for economic and social development,” said [Name], CEO of CSOAI. “We are thrilled to partner with the nation to build a robust safety framework that will not only foster innovation but also build trust and ensure that AI benefits all citizens.”

CSOAI’s solution includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, a professional certification program (CEASAI) for local AI safety analysts, a decentralized governance model, and a continuous improvement methodology. The initiative also includes a significant training component, with a £1 billion global giveaway that provides free access to the CEASAI certification for citizens of the Dominican Republic.

This partnership will enable the Dominican Republic to align with international standards, such as the EU AI Act, and create a skilled workforce to oversee the country’s growing AI ecosystem. CSOAI invites government officials, business leaders, and civil society organizations to collaborate on this important initiative.

**About CSOAI:**

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is a global organization dedicated to promoting the safe and ethical development of Artificial Intelligence. We provide governments and organizations with the tools, expertise, and training needed to build robust AI safety frameworks.

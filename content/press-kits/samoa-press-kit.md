## Press Release Template

_**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**_

**[City, Samoa] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a groundbreaking initiative to provide Samoa with a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This move comes as the nation, like many others, stands on the cusp of a technological revolution, and aims to ensure that the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is managed safely and ethically.

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, looming, the urgency for nations to establish robust AI governance has never been greater. CSOAI's framework is designed to be tailored to Samoa's unique cultural and societal context, providing a clear roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.

“AI presents both immense opportunities and significant risks,” said [Name, Title], of CSOAI. “Our goal is to empower Samoa to harness the power of AI for the benefit of all its citizens, while mitigating potential harms. This framework is not just about compliance; it’s about building a future where AI is a tool for inclusive growth and societal well-being.”

The CSOAI solution includes the globally recognized CEASAI Certification for AI safety professionals, a decentralized multi-agent system for AI oversight, and a continuous improvement methodology for AI safety and compliance. As part of its commitment to building global AI safety capacity, CSOAI is also offering free CEASAI certification to Samoan citizens through its £1 Billion Training Giveaway.

“By training a new generation of AI safety professionals, we can build a sustainable ecosystem of expertise in Samoa and across the Pacific,” added [Name, Title]. “We are not just providing a framework; we are investing in the human capital that will be essential for navigating the complexities of the AI-driven future.”

CSOAI is inviting Samoan government officials, business leaders, and civil society organizations to partner in this initiative. To learn more about the AI Safety Framework and the training opportunities, please visit [Website] or contact [Email].

**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Albania to Meet EU AI Act Deadline**

**TIRANA, ALBANIA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal for a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework for Albania. This initiative is designed to help the nation meet the upcoming February 2, 2026, deadline for compliance with the European Union’s AI Act and to establish Albania as a regional leader in responsible AI governance.

Albania has demonstrated a strong commitment to digital transformation, highlighted by the recent appointment of the world's first AI minister and significant investments in AI technology. However, a governance gap remains. CSOAI’s proposed framework will provide a turnkey solution to address this gap, offering a clear path to AI safety and compliance.

“Albania is at a pivotal moment. The government’s forward-thinking initiatives have set the stage for a vibrant AI ecosystem, but a robust governance framework is essential to ensure that this development is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all Albanians,” said [Your Name/CSOAI Spokesperson], [Your Title] at CSOAI. “Our AI Safety Framework provides the tools and expertise Albania needs to build a prosperous and secure AI-powered future.”

CSOAI’s solution includes:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A customizable, EU AI Act-compliant framework that can be seamlessly integrated into Albania’s legal and institutional landscape.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A training and accreditation program to create a new generation of AI safety professionals in Albania.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight:** A decentralized, fault-tolerant system for impartial AI oversight.
*   **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A clear, risk-based methodology for businesses and government agencies to ensure AI compliance.

As part of its global commitment to AI safety, CSOAI is also offering Albanian citizens free access to its CEASAI Certification program through its £1 billion training giveaway. This initiative aims to train 500,250 AI safety analysts worldwide, creating immediate capacity in this critical field.

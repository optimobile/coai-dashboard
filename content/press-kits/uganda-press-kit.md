**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Uganda to Secure its Digital Future**

**KAMPALA, UGANDA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal to partner with the Ugandan government to implement a comprehensive national AI Safety Framework. The proposed framework aims to empower Uganda to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) while mitigating potential risks, ensuring the nation's digital sovereignty and the safety of its citizens.

With the global AI landscape rapidly evolving and the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a proactive approach to AI governance in Uganda is more urgent than ever. CSOAI's proposed white-label framework provides a clear roadmap for developing and deploying safe and ethical AI, tailored to Uganda's unique context and needs.

"Uganda has a remarkable opportunity to become a leader in AI safety and innovation in Africa," said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "By establishing a robust governance framework now, Uganda can build a thriving and equitable digital economy, create high-skilled jobs, and ensure that AI is a force for good for all its citizens."

CSOAI's solution includes the CEASAI Certification program, which will train and certify 1,000 Ugandan professionals as AI Safety Analysts, creating a local workforce to oversee the implementation of the framework. The proposal also includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, ensuring a decentralized and inclusive approach to governance.

As part of its commitment to global AI safety, CSOAI is offering a £1 billion training giveaway, providing free access to the CEASAI certification program for Ugandan citizens. This initiative will create immediate capacity for AI safety and governance in the country.

CSOAI is calling on the Ugandan government to engage in a dialogue to explore this partnership and take a decisive step towards securing its digital future.

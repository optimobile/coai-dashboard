## Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[City, State, Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic initiative to support Armenia in developing a national AI safety framework. This initiative comes as the deadline for compliance with the European Union’s AI Act on February 2, 2026, approaches, creating a sense of urgency for nations to establish robust AI governance structures.

CSOAI is offering Armenia its white-label AI Safety Framework, a customizable solution that provides a clear roadmap for the safe and ethical development and deployment of artificial intelligence. The framework is designed to be adapted to Armenia’s specific legal, cultural, and economic landscape, ensuring a tailored approach to AI governance.

“Armenia has a burgeoning technology sector and is making significant strides in AI adoption. Now is the critical moment to establish a comprehensive AI safety framework to mitigate risks and foster an environment of trust and innovation,” said [Name], CEO of CSOAI. “Our framework provides a clear path for Armenia to become a regional leader in responsible AI development.”

As part of this initiative, CSOAI is also offering Armenian citizens free access to its CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts International) certification program. This program aims to train a new generation of local AI safety experts who can lead the implementation and oversight of the national AI framework. CSOAI is committing to training 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Armenia.

CSOAI’s solution also includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, a decentralized oversight body, and the implementation of the SOAI-PDCA (Safety of AI - Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology.

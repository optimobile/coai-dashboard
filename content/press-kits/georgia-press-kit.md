## CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Georgia to Secure its Position as a Global Tech Hub

**[CITY, STATE] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a formal proposal to the government of Georgia to implement a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to secure Georgia’s rapidly growing status as a global technology and innovation hub by establishing a robust governance structure for artificial intelligence. The proposed framework will enable Georgia to align with international standards, such as the EU’s AI Act, and mitigate the risks associated with the unchecked proliferation of AI technologies.

Georgia is currently home to over 14,000 technology companies, contributing over $50 billion to the state's economy annually. With an expected 100,000 new tech jobs by 2033, primarily driven by AI, the state is at a critical juncture. The absence of a comprehensive AI governance framework, however, leaves Georgia vulnerable to economic and social risks, including non-compliance with international regulations and an erosion of public trust.

“Georgia’s rapid technological growth is a double-edged sword,” said a spokesperson for CSOAI. “Without a robust AI governance framework, the very innovation that promises prosperity could expose our citizens and businesses to significant risks. The time for proactive, responsible AI governance is now.”

CSOAI’s proposed solution includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, the CEASAI Certification program for local professionals, the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. As part of this initiative, CSOAI is also offering Georgian citizens free access to its CEASAI certification program through its £1 billion global training giveaway.

“The CSOAI’s framework is not about stifling innovation; it’s about enabling it,” the spokesperson continued. “By providing a clear and ethical roadmap for AI development, we empower Georgian businesses to lead the world in responsible AI.”

CSOAI is calling on Georgian government officials, business leaders, and civil society to engage in a dialogue about the implementation of this framework. The organization believes that a collaborative approach is essential to building a safe and prosperous AI-powered future for Georgia.

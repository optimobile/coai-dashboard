FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Paraguay to Pioneer Responsible AI in Latin America**

**[City, Paraguay] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal to implement a comprehensive, nationwide AI Safety Framework for Paraguay. This initiative aims to establish robust governance and ethical guidelines for the country's rapidly growing artificial intelligence sector, ensuring that technological advancement aligns with public safety, economic stability, and fundamental human rights.

The proposed framework arrives at a critical moment, as Paraguay attracts significant international investment in AI infrastructure, including an $8 billion data center project. While these developments promise substantial economic growth, they also introduce complex risks without a national regulatory structure. CSOAI's framework is designed to fill this gap, providing the tools and strategies necessary for Paraguay to become a regional leader in responsible AI innovation ahead of the EU's 2026 AI Act deadline.

"Paraguay has a unique opportunity to build its digital future on a foundation of safety, trust, and ethical principles," said a spokesperson for CSOAI. "Our framework is not about stifling innovation; it's about enabling it responsibly. By creating a secure and predictable regulatory environment, Paraguay can unlock the full potential of AI to drive economic prosperity while safeguarding its citizens."

The CSOAI solution includes:
*   A **White-label AI Safety Framework** that can be customized to Paraguay's specific national context.
*   The **CEASAI Certification program**, aimed at training and certifying a local workforce of AI safety analysts.
*   A **33-Agent Byzantine Council**, an independent oversight body to ensure impartial governance.
*   The **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology** for continuous risk management and improvement.

As part of its global commitment to building AI safety capacity, CSOAI is extending its **£1 Billion Training Giveaway** to Paraguay. This program offers free CEASAI certification to Paraguayan citizens, creating immediate access to world-class training and professional development in the AI safety field.

**About CSOAI:**

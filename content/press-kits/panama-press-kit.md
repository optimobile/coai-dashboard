**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Panama Poised to Become a Regional Leader in AI Governance with New National AI Safety Framework**

**PANAMA CITY, Panama – [Date]** – As the global community grapples with the transformative power of artificial intelligence, Panama is taking a decisive step to ensure the safe and ethical development of AI within its borders. The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is proud to announce a strategic partnership with key stakeholders in Panama to implement a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This initiative will position Panama as a regional leader in AI governance and unlock the full potential of AI to drive economic growth and social progress.

"Panama's proactive approach to AI governance is a testament to its forward-thinking leadership," said [CSOAI Representative Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "By establishing a robust AI safety framework, Panama is not only mitigating the risks associated with AI but also creating a fertile ground for innovation and investment. We are honored to be a part of this historic journey."

The AI Safety Framework, developed by CSOAI, provides a comprehensive and customizable blueprint for building a national AI ecosystem that is safe, reliable, and ethical. The framework includes a suite of tools and methodologies for risk assessment, ethical impact analysis, and regulatory compliance. A key component of the initiative is the CEASAI Certification program, which will train and certify a local workforce of AI safety professionals, empowering Panamanians to lead the charge in responsible AI development.

To ensure robust oversight and accountability, the framework proposes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, a decentralized and resilient governance body composed of diverse stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society. This council will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the national AI strategy and providing guidance on emerging ethical and regulatory challenges.

As part of its commitment to building a global community of AI safety professionals, CSOAI is offering a £1 billion training giveaway, which will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including a significant allocation for Panamanian citizens. This initiative will create a pipeline of skilled professionals who can drive Panama's AI ambitions forward.

**About CSOAI:**

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is a global leader in AI safety and governance. We provide governments, businesses, and organizations with the tools, training, and expertise to navigate the complexities of AI and build a safe and prosperous AI-powered future.

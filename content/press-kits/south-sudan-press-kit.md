**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for South Sudan to Boost Economic Growth and Mitigate Risks**

**JUBA, South Sudan – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today unveiled a comprehensive proposal for a national AI Safety Framework for South Sudan. The initiative aims to guide the country in harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for economic development while mitigating potential risks. The proposal comes as the nation pushes forward with its digital transformation agenda, including the full digitization of all public institutions by 2025.

CSOAI’s proposed framework offers a four-part solution, including a white-label AI Safety Framework adaptable to South Sudan’s needs, a professional certification program (CEASAI) to train local AI safety experts, a decentralized 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

“South Sudan has a unique opportunity to leapfrog legacy systems and build a future-proof digital economy,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our framework is designed to empower the nation to do just that, by providing the tools and expertise needed to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI ecosystem.”

As part of its commitment to building local capacity, CSOAI is offering free training to thousands of South Sudanese citizens through its £1 Billion Training Giveaway. This initiative will provide free access to the CEASAI certification program, creating a large pool of qualified AI safety analysts in the country.

“The development of a national AI strategy is not just about technology; it’s about building a more inclusive and prosperous future for all South Sudanese,” said [Name and Title of a South Sudanese official, e.g., Minister of Information]. “We welcome CSOAI’s proposal and look forward to working with them to build a digital future that is safe, secure, and beneficial for all.”

## Press Release Template

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, State, Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic initiative to support the development of a national AI Safety Framework for Syria. This initiative aims to provide the Syrian government, private sector, and civil society with the tools and expertise to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI ecosystem.

As Syria embarks on a path of reconstruction and digital transformation, the adoption of artificial intelligence presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant risks. The CSOAI’s initiative will provide a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be customized to Syria’s specific needs, as well as a range of training and capacity-building programs.

“We believe that a safe and ethical AI ecosystem can only be built through a collective and inclusive effort,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at the Council of Safe AI. “We are committed to empowering Syria with the tools and expertise to build a future where AI is a force for good, a tool for empowerment, and a cornerstone of a more just, equitable, and prosperous society.”

Key components of the initiative include:

*   **A white-label AI Safety Framework:** A turnkey solution that can be customized to align with Syria’s specific legal, cultural, and societal context.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** An intensive training and certification program designed to create a new generation of AI safety professionals within Syria.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** A decentralized and distributed oversight body to ensure robust and impartial governance.
*   **The £1 Billion Training Giveaway:** Free access to the CEASAI certification program for Syrian citizens.

“AI is not a silver bullet, but when combined with local knowledge and international partnerships, it can be a strategic tool for Syria’s gradual recovery and development,” said Dr. Firas Bakour, Chairman of the Arab Internet and Telecom Union (ARISPA).

## Key Messages

### AI Challenges in Syria
- **Infrastructure Deficit:** Syria faces significant challenges in its digital infrastructure, including unreliable electricity and limited internet access, which are fundamental prerequisites for a thriving AI ecosystem.
- **Human Capital Flight:** The conflict has led to a substantial 'brain drain,' with a significant loss of skilled professionals in technology and engineering, hindering the growth of a local AI talent pool.
- **Governance and Ethical Risks:** In the absence of a formal AI governance framework, there is a high risk of AI being used for surveillance and digital repression, as well as the potential for algorithmic bias to exacerbate social inequalities.
- **Economic and Political Instability:** The ongoing political and economic instability, coupled with international sanctions, creates a challenging environment for investment in AI and digital technologies.

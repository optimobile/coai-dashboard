**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Nepal to Avert Governance Crisis**

**KATHMANDU, NEPAL, [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal to implement a comprehensive AI Safety Framework in Nepal, a nation on the verge of a technological revolution but lacking the necessary governance to manage the risks of artificial intelligence. With the European Union's AI Act deadline looming in February 2026, CSOAI's initiative aims to equip Nepal with the tools and expertise to build a safe and ethical AI ecosystem.

Nepal is one of 118 countries without a formal AI governance framework, exposing it to significant risks, including biased algorithms, data privacy violations, and stifled innovation. CSOAI's white-label AI Safety Framework offers a customizable solution that can be rapidly deployed to address these challenges. The framework includes the globally recognized CEASAI Certification for AI safety professionals, the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

"Nepal has a golden opportunity to become a leader in responsible AI adoption," said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title]. "Our framework will not only mitigate the risks but also unlock the immense potential of AI to drive economic growth and improve the lives of Nepalese citizens."

As part of its commitment to building global AI safety capacity, CSOAI is offering free CEASAI certification to 500,250 analysts worldwide, including in Nepal. This £1 billion training giveaway will create a skilled workforce capable of navigating the complexities of AI governance.

CSOAI is calling on Nepalese government officials, business leaders, and civil society to collaborate on this critical initiative. For more information, please visit [CSOAI Website] or contact [Press Contact Email].

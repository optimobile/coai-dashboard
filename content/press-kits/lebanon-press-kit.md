**BEIRUT, LEBANON – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a comprehensive initiative to help Lebanon establish a national AI safety and governance framework. As one of 118 countries currently without AI regulation, Lebanon faces significant risks of being left behind in the global digital economy. CSOAI's turnkey solution, which includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a compliance methodology, provides Lebanon with a clear roadmap to building a safe, ethical, and competitive AI ecosystem.

"Lebanon has the talent, the entrepreneurial spirit, and the geostrategic location to become a regional leader in AI," said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title].

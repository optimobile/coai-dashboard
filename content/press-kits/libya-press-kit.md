# Press Kit: AI Safety Framework for Libya

## Press Release Template

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**CSOAI Offers Libya a Comprehensive AI Safety Framework to Secure its Digital Future**

**TRIPOLI, Libya – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a formal proposal to the Libyan government to implement a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to equip Libya with the necessary regulatory and technical infrastructure to navigate the complexities of artificial intelligence and secure its position in the global digital economy.

The proposal comes at a critical time, as Libya embraces AI with the recent launch of its first national AI model, LIBIGPT. However, the nation currently lacks a dedicated AI governance framework, placing it among 118 countries without a national AI strategy. This regulatory gap poses significant risks to citizens and businesses, particularly with the impending enforcement of the EU's AI Act in February 2026.

"Libya has a unique opportunity to leapfrog into a future of safe and responsible AI," said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a turnkey solution that can be customized to Libya's specific needs, enabling the nation to build its own sovereign AI governance capability."

CSOAI's proposal includes three key components:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A ready-to-deploy regulatory and technical infrastructure for AI governance.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** Free training and certification for 1,000 Libyan AI Safety Analysts through a £1 billion global training giveaway.
*   **A 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** A decentralized, multi-stakeholder body for robust and impartial AI oversight.

"By training a local workforce of AI safety experts and establishing a resilient governance structure, we are not just offering a solution; we are building a sustainable ecosystem for safe AI in Libya," added [Name].

CSOAI is calling on Libyan government officials, business leaders, and civil society to join in a national dialogue on AI safety and governance.

**About CSOAI:**

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is a global organization dedicated to promoting the safe and ethical development of artificial intelligence. We provide governments and organizations with the tools, training, and expertise to build robust AI safety frameworks and foster a culture of responsible innovation.

# Press Kit: AI Safety Framework for Maldives

## Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[City, Maldives] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic partnership with the Republic of Maldives to deploy a national AI Safety Framework, a landmark initiative designed to build a resilient and responsible AI ecosystem in the island nation. This collaboration will position the Maldives as a regional leader in AI governance, ensuring that the benefits of AI are harnessed for sustainable development and economic growth while mitigating potential risks.

The partnership will see the implementation of CSOAI’s white-label AI Safety Framework, a comprehensive and customizable governance model that will be tailored to the unique needs of the Maldives. The framework is built upon the SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, a proven approach to continuous improvement in safety and quality management. A key component of the initiative is the training and certification of 1,000 Maldivian citizens as AI Safety Analysts through the CEASAI Certification program, creating a skilled local workforce to manage the nation’s AI landscape.

“We are thrilled to partner with the Maldives to build a safe and prosperous AI future for the nation,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “This partnership is a testament to the Maldivian government’s forward-thinking approach to technology and its commitment to the well-being of its citizens. Our AI Safety Framework will provide the Maldives with the tools, training, and expertise to navigate the complexities of the AI era with confidence.”

The initiative comes at a critical time, with the European Union’s AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching. By proactively establishing a robust AI governance framework, the Maldives is not only ensuring compliance with emerging international standards but also creating a competitive advantage in the global digital economy.

**CSOAI Offers Romania a Turnkey Solution for AI Governance Ahead of EU AI Act Deadline**

**BUCHAREST, ROMANIA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced its commitment to helping Romania establish a comprehensive AI safety framework ahead of the EU AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026. CSOAI offers a white-label AI Safety Framework, professional certification, and a proven compliance methodology to help Romania navigate the complexities of AI governance and unlock the full potential of artificial intelligence.

With the rapid advancement of AI, Romania faces both immense opportunities and significant risks. The absence of a robust governance structure can lead to challenges in ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI, potentially hindering the country's digital transformation and economic growth.

CSOAI's solution is designed to bridge this gap by providing a customizable and ready-to-deploy framework that is aligned with international best practices and the requirements of the EU AI Act. The framework is complemented by the CEASAI certification program, which will train and accredit local AI safety experts, creating a sustainable ecosystem for AI governance in Romania.

"We believe that a proactive and collaborative approach is key to building a safe and prosperous digital future for Romania," said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "Our goal is to empower Romania with the tools and expertise needed to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks."

CSOAI's implementation roadmap for Romania includes a four-phased approach, starting with an assessment and planning phase, followed by framework deployment, training of AI Safety Analysts, and achieving full operational capability.

As part of its global commitment to AI safety, CSOAI is also offering a £1 billion training giveaway, providing free access to its CEASAI certification program for aspiring AI Safety Analysts in Romania and around the world.

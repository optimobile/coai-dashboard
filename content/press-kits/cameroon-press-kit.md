## Press Release Template

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, Cameroon] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a groundbreaking initiative to provide Cameroon with a comprehensive AI Safety Framework, aimed at accelerating the nation's digital transformation and establishing it as a leader in responsible AI. This initiative includes a white-label AI safety framework, a world-class certification program for local professionals, and a £1 billion global training giveaway.

As Cameroon embraces the potential of Artificial Intelligence, the need for a robust governance framework has become critical. The CSOAI’s solution is designed to address this gap, providing a ready-to-deploy regulatory and technical infrastructure that can be customized to Cameroon’s unique needs. This will enable Cameroonian businesses to comply with international standards, such as the EU's AI Act, and compete effectively in the global market.

"We are thrilled to partner with Cameroon to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI future," said [Name, Title] of CSOAI. "Our framework will not only mitigate the risks associated with AI but also unlock its immense potential to drive economic growth and create new opportunities for the people of Cameroon."

Key components of the CSOAI’s initiative include:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A flexible and scalable system that empowers Cameroon to establish its own sovereign AI governance.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A training program to build local capacity by certifying a new generation of AI safety professionals in Cameroon.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI:** An innovative, multi-stakeholder governance model for robust and impartial AI oversight.
*   **A £1 Billion Training Giveaway:** Free access to the prestigious CEASAI certification for all Cameroonian citizens.

This initiative comes at a pivotal moment for Cameroon, as the country implements its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (SNIA). By providing the necessary tools, training, and governance structures, CSOAI’s program will help Cameroon achieve its ambitious goals of creating 12,000 jobs and training 60,000 AI professionals by 2040.

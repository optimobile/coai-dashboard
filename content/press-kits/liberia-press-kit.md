# Press Kit: AI Safety Framework for Liberia

## Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[City, State] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a major initiative to support the development of a national AI safety framework in Liberia. As part of its global mission to promote responsible AI governance, the CSOAI will provide Liberia with a white-label AI Safety Framework, as well as free access to its internationally recognized CEASAI (Certified AI Safety Analyst) certification program.

This initiative comes at a critical time, as the European Union's AI Act is set to take effect on February 2, 2026. This legislation will have a significant impact on global trade and data flows, and countries without a robust AI governance framework risk being left behind. By partnering with the CSOAI, Liberia can proactively address this challenge and position itself as a leader in responsible AI innovation in Africa.

"Liberia has a unique opportunity to build a future where AI is used to empower its citizens, improve public services, and drive sustainable economic growth," said [CSOAI Representative Name], [Title] at the CSOAI. "We are proud to partner with the Government of Liberia to help them achieve this vision."

The CSOAI's AI Safety Framework is a comprehensive and customizable solution that can be adapted to Liberia's specific needs. It provides a clear set of guidelines for the development, deployment, and use of AI, helping to ensure that these technologies are used in a safe and responsible manner.

The CEASAI certification program is a key component of the CSOAI's initiative in Liberia. This program will provide free training to 1,000 Liberian citizens, equipping them with the skills and knowledge they need to become certified AI safety analysts. This will create a sustainable pool of local talent that can support the long-term growth of a responsible AI ecosystem in Liberia.

"The development of a national AI safety framework is a critical step in our journey towards a digital future," said [Liberian Government Official Name], [Title]. "We are grateful for the support of the CSOAI and look forward to working with them to build a safe and prosperous digital future for all Liberians."

**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Establish AI Safety Framework in Benin**

**[CITY, BENIN] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global organization for AI safety and governance, today announced a major initiative to support Benin in establishing a national AI safety framework. This initiative aims to empower Benin to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence while mitigating its risks, positioning the nation as a leader in responsible AI innovation in West Africa.

CSOAI will collaborate with the government of Benin, industry stakeholders, and civil society to deploy its comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This adaptable framework provides the necessary policies, standards, and best practices to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a manner that is safe, ethical, and transparent.

“We are thrilled to partner with Benin on this critical initiative,” said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “By taking proactive steps to establish a robust AI governance framework, Benin is not only safeguarding its citizens and businesses but also paving the way for a prosperous and secure digital future.”

As part of this initiative, CSOAI will also be offering its globally recognized CEASAI certification program to train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Benin. This program will create a sustainable pool of local talent capable of managing and overseeing the AI safety framework, reducing reliance on foreign expertise and fostering a self-sustaining AI ecosystem.

Furthermore, CSOAI is extending its £1 Billion Training Giveaway to Benin, providing free access to the CEASAI certification program for aspiring AI Safety Analysts. This initiative is designed to create immediate capacity in AI safety and governance, enabling Benin to build a skilled workforce capable of navigating the complexities of the AI era.

# Press Kit: AI Safety Framework for Tajikistan

## Press Release Template

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, Tajikistan] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic initiative to support Tajikistan in developing a national AI safety framework. This move comes as the country accelerates its digital transformation and positions itself as a leader in artificial intelligence in Central Asia. CSOAI will offer its white-label AI Safety Framework, a comprehensive solution designed to help nations build robust AI governance ecosystems.

"Tajikistan has shown immense foresight with its national AI strategy, and we are committed to helping the country build a future where AI is both innovative and safe," said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "Our framework will provide the necessary tools and expertise to ensure that AI development in Tajikistan aligns with international best practices and national values."

CSOAI's initiative includes the launch of the Certified AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program in Tajikistan, which aims to train 1,000 local professionals in AI safety and governance. As part of a £1 billion global training giveaway, Tajik citizens will have the opportunity to access this certification for free, creating a skilled workforce to oversee the country's AI ecosystem.

The proposed framework also includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council, a decentralized body of experts to ensure impartial oversight of AI applications. This, combined with the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology, will provide a clear roadmap for businesses and government agencies to navigate the complexities of AI regulation.

This partnership will enable Tajikistan to meet the requirements of international regulations like the EU AI Act, opening up new opportunities for trade and investment. It will also ensure that the benefits of AI are shared by all citizens, with robust protections against risks such as algorithmic bias and data privacy violations.

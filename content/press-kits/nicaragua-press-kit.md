**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety Framework to Nicaragua**

**[CITY, STATE, DATE]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a new initiative to bring its world-class AI Safety Framework to Nicaragua. The initiative will provide the Nicaraguan government and private sector with the tools and expertise to build a safe and prosperous AI future.

"AI presents a tremendous opportunity for Nicaragua, but it also comes with significant risks," said [CSOAI SPOKESPERSON], [TITLE] of CSOAI. "Our AI Safety Framework is a comprehensive solution that will enable Nicaragua to harness the power of AI while mitigating the risks."

CSOAI's AI Safety Framework is a white-label solution that can be customized to meet the specific needs of Nicaragua. The framework is built on CSOAI's proprietary SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology, a proven system for continuous improvement and risk management.

In addition to the framework, CSOAI will also offer its CEASAI (Certified Expert in AI Safety and Auditing) certification program in Nicaragua. The program will train a new generation of AI safety experts to lead the country's AI transformation.

"We are committed to building local capacity and empowering Nicaraguans to take control of their AI future," said [CSOAI SPOKESPERSON]. "Through our £1 Billion Training Giveaway, we will provide free CEASAI certification to 1,000 individuals in Nicaragua."

The initiative comes as the world prepares for the European Union's AI Act, which is set to take effect in February 2026. The Act will have a global impact, setting a new standard for AI regulation.

"The EU AI Act is a game-changer," said [CSOAI SPOKESPERSON]. "Nicaraguan businesses that want to remain competitive in the global market will need to demonstrate compliance with these new standards. Our AI Safety Framework will provide them with a clear path to compliance."

CSOAI is inviting Nicaraguan government officials, business leaders, and civil society organizations to partner with them in this important initiative. To learn more, please visit [WEBSITE].

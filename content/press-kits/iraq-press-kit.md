## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety and Governance Framework to Iraq**

**[City, State, Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a major initiative to support the development of a national AI safety and governance framework in Iraq. The initiative includes a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework, a massive training program to certify 1,000 Iraqi AI Safety Analysts, and a £1 billion global training giveaway.

"Iraq is at a pivotal moment in its digital transformation, and the responsible adoption of AI will be critical for its future prosperity and security," said [Your Name/CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Your Title/CSOAI Spokesperson Title]. "CSOAI is committed to providing Iraq with the tools, resources, and expertise it needs to build a world-class AI governance framework that fosters innovation while protecting its citizens."

The CSOAI's initiative comes as the global community increasingly focuses on AI regulation, with the European Union's AI Act set to take effect in February 2026. By proactively establishing its own AI governance framework, Iraq can position itself as a leader in the region and ensure that its businesses and citizens can fully participate in the global AI economy.

The core of the CSOAI's offering is a customizable, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be adapted to Iraq's specific needs. The framework is complemented by the Certified European AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program, which will provide free training to 1,000 Iraqi citizens, creating a new generation of AI safety professionals in the country.

"We believe that building local capacity is essential for sustainable AI governance," said [Name], [Title]. "Our goal is to empower Iraqis with the skills and knowledge they need to lead the way in AI safety and to create a vibrant and responsible AI ecosystem in their country."

In addition to the framework and training, the CSOAI is also offering a decentralized AI-powered oversight mechanism, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology to ensure continuous improvement in AI safety.

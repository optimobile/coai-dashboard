**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Establish AI Safety Framework in Niger**

**NIAMEY, NIGER – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global organization in AI governance and safety, today announced a major initiative to support Niger in establishing a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative comes as the deadline for compliance with the European Union’s AI Act approaches, creating an urgent need for countries to develop robust AI governance structures.

Niger is one of 118 countries that have not yet developed a national AI strategy, a gap that could hinder its ability to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its risks. CSOAI’s initiative will provide Niger with a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework, tailored to the country’s specific needs and development goals. The framework includes the establishment of a national AI council, a compliance methodology for businesses, and a globally recognized certification program for AI safety professionals.

“We believe that AI has the potential to be a powerful engine for economic growth and social development in Niger,” said [Name], CEO of CSOAI. “Our goal is to empower Niger with the tools and expertise it needs to build a safe and prosperous AI future. By establishing a robust governance framework now, Niger can position itself as a leader in responsible AI innovation in the Sahel region.”

As part of this initiative, CSOAI is offering Nigerien citizens free access to its CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts International) certification program through its £1 Billion Training Giveaway. This program will create a new generation of AI safety professionals in Niger, equipped with the skills to oversee the development and deployment of AI technologies in the country.

CSOAI is inviting government officials, business leaders, and civil society organizations in Niger to collaborate on this important initiative. For more information, please visit [website] or contact [email].

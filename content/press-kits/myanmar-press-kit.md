**CSOAI Proposes AI Safety Framework for Myanmar to Address Governance Gap and Mitigate Risks**

**[CITY, STATE, COUNTRY] – [DATE]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a comprehensive proposal to establish a national AI Safety Framework for Myanmar. The initiative aims to address the country's current AI governance gap, mitigate the risks associated with unregulated AI, and empower Myanmar to harness the benefits of this transformative technology in a safe and ethical manner.

Myanmar is one of 118 countries without a national AI strategy, leaving it vulnerable to the potential misuse of AI for surveillance, the amplification of societal biases, and the erosion of fundamental human rights. The CSOAI's proposed framework provides a clear and actionable roadmap for Myanmar to build a robust AI governance ecosystem, tailored to its unique context.

"The rapid advancements in AI present both immense opportunities and significant risks for Myanmar," said [CSOAI SPOKESPERSON NAME], [TITLE] at CSOAI. "Our proposed AI Safety Framework is designed to help Myanmar navigate this complex landscape, enabling it to foster innovation while safeguarding the rights and interests of its citizens."

The CSOAI's solution includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, the CEASAI Certification program for local professionals, the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. As part of this initiative, the CSOAI is also offering a £1 billion training giveaway, which will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals globally, including a significant number of places for citizens of Myanmar.

"Building local capacity is crucial for the long-term success of any AI governance initiative," added [CSOAI SPOKESPERSON NAME]. "Through our free CEASAI certification program, we aim to empower the people of Myanmar with the skills and knowledge they need to shape their country's AI-powered future."

The CSOAI is calling on the government of Myanmar to partner with them to implement this vital initiative. The organization is confident that by working together, they can help Myanmar build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI-powered future for all its citizens.

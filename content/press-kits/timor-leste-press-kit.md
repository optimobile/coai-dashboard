# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Offers Timor-Leste a National AI Safety Framework to Bridge Governance Gap and Unlock Digital Potential**

**DILI, TIMOR-LESTE – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a global leader in AI safety and governance solutions, today announced a formal proposal to the government of Timor-Leste to implement a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to address the nation's AI governance gap, mitigate potential risks associated with artificial intelligence, and empower Timor-Leste to harness the full potential of the digital economy safely and ethically.

Timor-Leste is one of 118 countries currently without a formal AI governance framework, a situation that presents significant challenges as AI technology becomes more integrated into the global landscape. With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a robust national strategy has never been more urgent. The EU AI Act will have extraterritorial reach, impacting any Timorese entity processing the data of EU citizens.

CSOAI's proposed solution includes:

*   A **White-Label AI Safety Framework**, customized to Timor-Leste’s unique legal, cultural, and economic context.
*   The **CEASAI Certification program**, designed to train and certify local professionals as AI Safety Analysts, building in-country expertise.
*   The establishment of a **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI**, an independent oversight body composed of diverse national stakeholders.
*   The **SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology**, a practical framework for continuous risk management and improvement of AI systems.

"The age of AI is upon us, and proactive governance is not a luxury but a necessity," said [Name], CEO of CSOAI. "Our framework is designed to provide Timor-Leste with the tools, talent, and structure to not just navigate the risks of AI, but to confidently embrace its transformative power. We are committed to partnering with the nation to build a future where AI serves the best interests of all its citizens."

As part of its global commitment to building AI safety capacity, CSOAI is also offering citizens of Timor-Leste access to its **£1 Billion Training Giveaway**. This program provides free access to the CEASAI certification, aiming to train 500,250 analysts worldwide and create a global workforce of qualified AI safety professionals.

CSOAI is calling on government officials, business leaders, and civil society in Timor-Leste to engage in a national dialogue to chart a course for a secure and prosperous digital future.

**About CSOAI:**
The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) provides comprehensive AI safety certification and compliance solutions for governments and corporations worldwide. Through its white-label frameworks, professional certifications (CEASAI), and proven compliance methodologies (SOAI-PDCA), CSOAI empowers nations and organizations to manage AI risks and foster responsible innovation.

## Key Messages

### AI Challenges in Timor-Leste
*   **Evolving Governmental Stance:** The government is only now starting to incorporate AI into its digital strategy, indicating a reactive rather than proactive approach.
*   **Inadequate Infrastructure:** While there are investments in foundational infrastructure, existing networks are aging and require significant upgrades to support advanced AI applications.
*   **Legal and Policy Gaps:** The absence of a specific legal and administrative framework for AI creates uncertainty and hinders the development of a comprehensive national AI policy.
*   **Significant Digital Divide:** There is a substantial risk that AI could exacerbate existing inequalities in digital access and literacy, particularly between urban and rural populations and different gender groups.
*   **Shortage of AI Talent:** A major hurdle is the lack of a skilled workforce in AI development and the absence of AI in the national education curriculum.

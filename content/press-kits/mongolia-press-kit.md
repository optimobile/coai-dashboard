## Press Release Template

# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced the launch of a comprehensive AI Safety Framework for Mongolia, a strategic initiative designed to help the nation build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI-powered future. This announcement comes as Mongolia, along with 117 other countries, works to establish a national AI governance strategy ahead of the EU’s 2026 AI Act deadline.

“Mongolia has a unique opportunity to become a leader in responsible AI adoption,” said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our AI Safety Framework provides a clear and actionable roadmap for achieving this goal, empowering Mongolia to harness the full potential of AI for economic growth and social progress while mitigating the risks.”

The CSOAI’s solution for Mongolia includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, the CEASAI Certification program for local professionals, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. This comprehensive approach is designed to address the country’s specific needs and challenges, including a shortage of AI talent and the need for a robust regulatory environment.

As part of its commitment to building a global community of AI safety experts, CSOAI is also offering Mongolian citizens free access to its CEASAI certification program through its £1 Billion Training Giveaway. This initiative aims to train 500,250 AI safety analysts worldwide, creating a pipeline of skilled professionals who can support the implementation of the AI Safety Framework in Mongolia and around the world.

“We believe that the key to unlocking the full potential of AI lies in investing in people,” said [Name]. “By providing free access to our world-class certification program, we are empowering Mongolians to take ownership of their AI future and to become a part of the next generation of AI leaders.”

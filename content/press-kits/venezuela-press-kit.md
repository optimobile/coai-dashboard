## Key Messages

### AI Challenges in Venezuela
*   **Lack of a formal AI governance framework:** Venezuela is one of 118 countries without a national strategy for artificial intelligence, creating significant legal and ethical risks.
*   **Economic and political instability:** The country's ongoing economic and political challenges have historically hindered technological advancement and investment in AI.
*   **Intellectual property gap:** Existing legislation, such as the 1993 Copyright Law and the 1955 Industrial Property Law, is outdated and does not address the unique challenges of AI-generated content, data mining, or AI-assisted inventorship.
*   **Job displacement:** The rise of generative AI is automating digital micro-tasks, leading to job losses for many Venezuelans who rely on this work for income.

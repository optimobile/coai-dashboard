# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, State, Country] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic initiative to support the Kingdom of Morocco in developing a robust national AI safety and governance framework. This initiative comes as the global community prepares for the implementation of the European Union’s AI Act, creating a critical window of opportunity for Morocco to establish itself as a regional leader in responsible AI.

CSOAI will offer its white-label AI Safety Framework, a comprehensive and customizable solution designed to align with Morocco’s unique legal and cultural landscape. The framework includes the establishment of an independent oversight council, a world-class certification program (CEASAI) for local AI Safety Analysts, and a practical compliance methodology (SOAI-PDCA) for businesses.

“Morocco has demonstrated a strong commitment to digital transformation, and we believe that a proactive approach to AI governance is the essential next step,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title]. “Our framework will empower Morocco to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating the risks, fostering innovation, and building trust among citizens and businesses.”

As part of its global commitment to building a safe AI ecosystem, CSOAI is also offering a £1 billion training giveaway, providing free access to its CEASAI certification program to 500,250 individuals worldwide. Moroccan citizens are encouraged to apply and become part of a new generation of AI safety professionals.

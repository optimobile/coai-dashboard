_FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE_

**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Establish AI Safety Framework in Guatemala**

**GUATEMALA CITY, [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a major initiative to support Guatemala in developing a national AI Safety Framework. This move comes as the country embraces digital transformation and aims to position itself as a leader in responsible AI adoption in Central America. The initiative includes access to a white-label AI Safety Framework, free training for 1,000 AI Safety Analysts, and the establishment of a pioneering 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight.

With the European Union's AI Act deadline of February 2, 2026, fast approaching, the need for a robust AI governance framework has never been more urgent. CSOAI's comprehensive solution is designed to help Guatemala bridge the AI governance gap, mitigate risks such as algorithmic bias and job displacement, and foster an environment of trust and innovation.

"Guatemala has a unique opportunity to become a model for responsible AI adoption in the region," said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "Our framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution but a flexible and adaptable roadmap that can be tailored to Guatemala's specific needs and priorities. We are committed to working closely with all stakeholders to ensure a successful implementation."

As part of the initiative, CSOAI is offering free CEASAI certification to 1,000 Guatemalan citizens. This program will create a new generation of AI safety professionals, building local capacity and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the framework.

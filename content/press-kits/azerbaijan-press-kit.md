**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Establish AI Safety Framework in Azerbaijan**

**BAKU, Azerbaijan – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a new initiative to support the development and implementation of a comprehensive AI Safety Framework in Azerbaijan. This initiative aims to help Azerbaijan harness the full potential of Artificial Intelligence while mitigating its risks and ensuring that the technology is developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner.

"Azerbaijan has made significant strides in its digital transformation journey, and AI is poised to play a pivotal role in the nation's future economic growth," said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "However, with this great opportunity comes a great responsibility. Our AI Safety Framework provides a clear and practical roadmap for Azerbaijan to build a safe and trustworthy AI ecosystem that is aligned with international best practices and the values of its citizens."

The CSOAI's proposed framework for Azerbaijan includes four key components:

*   A white-label AI Safety Framework that can be customized to the specific needs of the nation.
*   The CEASAI (Certified AI Safety Analyst) certification program to build local capacity in AI safety.
*   A 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI to provide robust oversight and accountability.
*   The SOAI-PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) compliance methodology to help organizations systematically manage AI risks.

As part of this initiative, CSOAI is also offering a £1 billion training giveaway, which will provide free access to the CEASAI certification program for thousands of individuals in Azerbaijan and around the world. This program is designed to create a new generation of AI safety professionals who can support the long-term sustainability of the AI safety framework.

"We believe that a proactive and collaborative approach to AI governance is essential for building a safe and prosperous future with AI," added [Name]. "We look forward to working with our partners in Azerbaijan to make this vision a reality."

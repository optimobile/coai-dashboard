**DJIBOUTI CITY, Djibouti – [Date]** – The Government of Djibouti, in a landmark move to embrace the future of artificial intelligence, has announced a strategic partnership with the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) to implement a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative will position Djibouti as a leader in AI governance in the Horn of Africa and prepare the nation for the upcoming EU AI Act deadline.

The partnership will see the deployment of CSOAI’s comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework, which includes the CEASAI Certification for local professionals, a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. This will enable Djibouti to build a resilient and ethical AI ecosystem, fostering innovation while ensuring the safety and security of its digital future.

“[The Government of Djibouti is committed to harnessing the power of AI for the benefit of our citizens. This partnership with CSOAI is a critical step in our journey towards digital transformation and will ensure that we are at the forefront of responsible AI innovation],” said [Name and Title of Government Official].

As part of the initiative, CSOAI will provide free CEASAI certification training to 1,000 Djiboutian citizens, creating a local talent pool of AI safety analysts. This is part of CSOAI’s £1 Billion Training Giveaway, which aims to train 500,250 AI safety analysts worldwide.

“[We are thrilled to partner with Djibouti to build a safe and prosperous digital future. Our AI Safety Framework will provide the country with the tools and expertise it needs to navigate the complexities of the AI landscape and to unlock the full potential of this transformative technology],” said [Name and Title of CSOAI Representative].

The implementation of the AI Safety Framework will be carried out in a phased approach, starting with a comprehensive assessment of Djibouti’s existing digital infrastructure and legal landscape. The framework will then be deployed, followed by the training of AI safety analysts, with the goal of achieving full operational capability within a year.

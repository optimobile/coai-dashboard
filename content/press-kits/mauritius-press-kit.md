## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**CSOAI Offers AI Safety Framework to Mauritius to Boost Digital Economy and Meet Global Standards**

**[City, State, Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced its proposal to provide Mauritius with a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to help Mauritius establish a robust AI governance ecosystem, accelerate its digital transformation, and ensure compliance with emerging international standards such as the EU AI Act.

Mauritius is at a pivotal moment in its technological development. The government has shown a strong commitment to embracing artificial intelligence, with plans to integrate AI into 50% of public services by 2030. However, like 118 other countries, Mauritius currently lacks a comprehensive AI-specific regulatory framework, which poses risks to its economy and citizens.

"Mauritius has the potential to be a leader in ethical AI in Africa," said [Your Name/CSOAI Spokesperson], [Your Title] at CSOAI. "By implementing a robust AI safety framework now, Mauritius can create a trusted environment for AI innovation, attract foreign investment, and ensure that its businesses can compete on the global stage."

CSOAI's solution for Mauritius includes:

*   A **white-label AI Safety Framework** that can be customized to the nation's specific needs.
*   The **CEASAI certification program** to train and certify local AI safety professionals.
*   The **33-Agent Byzantine Council**, a decentralized and resilient oversight body for the AI ecosystem.
*   The **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology** to ensure continuous improvement in AI safety.

As part of its commitment to global AI safety, CSOAI is also offering a **£1 billion training giveaway**, which will provide free access to the CEASAI certification program for citizens of Mauritius. The goal is to train 500,250 AI Safety Analysts worldwide, creating a global network of experts dedicated to the safe and ethical use of AI.

**About CSOAI:**

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is a global organization dedicated to promoting the safe and ethical development of artificial intelligence. We provide governments and businesses with the tools, training, and expertise they need to navigate the complex challenges of the AI era.

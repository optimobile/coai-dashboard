**Palestine to Build National AI Safety Framework with the Council of Safe AI**

**[CITY, Palestine] – [Date]** – The Palestinian Authority today announced a landmark partnership with the Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) to develop and implement a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative will position Palestine as a regional leader in responsible AI governance and prepare the country for the upcoming EU AI Act deadline.

“The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence presents both immense opportunities and significant risks,” said [Name, Title of Palestinian Official]. “By partnering with the CSOAI, we are taking a proactive approach to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner that benefits all Palestinians.”

The AI Safety Framework will provide a comprehensive set of guidelines and best practices for AI governance, covering areas such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and public transparency. The framework will be tailored to the specific needs and context of Palestine and will be implemented in phases over the next two years.

A key component of the partnership is the establishment of a local AI safety workforce. Through the CSOAI’s £1 billion training giveaway, 1,000 Palestinian citizens will receive free certification as AI Safety Analysts, creating a new generation of experts to lead the implementation of the framework.

“We are honored to partner with the Palestinian Authority on this historic initiative,” said [Name, Title of CSOAI Representative]. “Our mission is to empower countries around the world with the tools and expertise they need to navigate the complexities of AI governance. We are confident that this partnership will not only benefit Palestine but also serve as a model for other nations in the region.”

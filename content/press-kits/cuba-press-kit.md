**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety Framework to Cuba**

**[City, State] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a new initiative to bring its internationally recognized AI Safety Framework to Cuba.

The CSOAI’s framework is a comprehensive, customizable solution that includes a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. The initiative also includes the CEASAI certification program, which will train a new generation of AI safety analysts in Cuba.

“We are excited to partner with the Cuban government, businesses, and academic institutions to build a safe and prosperous digital future for the country,” said [Name]. “Through our £1 Billion Training Giveaway, we are offering free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals worldwide, and we encourage Cuban citizens to take advantage of this unique opportunity.”

## Key Messages

### AI Challenges in Cuba
- **Infrastructure Deficiencies:** Cuba's AI development is significantly hampered by unreliable internet connectivity, frequent and prolonged power outages, and limited access to the specialized computing hardware required for advanced AI model training and deployment.
- **Economic and Talent Constraints:** The ongoing economic blockade restricts access to crucial technology and financial resources, while the nation struggles with a "brain drain" of skilled professionals in mathematics and computer science, who are often lured by more lucrative opportunities abroad.
- **Sovereign AI Development:** Despite challenges, Cuba is actively pursuing technological sovereignty through initiatives like the CecilIA language model and the national AI Consortium, aiming to create AI systems that reflect its unique cultural and social values.
- **Strategic Sectoral Application:** There are significant opportunities to apply AI in key sectors such as healthcare for diagnostics and resource optimization, and in agriculture for improving crop yields and managing resources in the face of climate change.

### Recommended Partnership Tier
Capacity Building (£100K)

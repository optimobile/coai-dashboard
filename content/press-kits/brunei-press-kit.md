**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Brunei**

**[City, Brunei] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal to partner with the government of Brunei Darussalam to implement a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to establish Brunei as a regional leader in responsible AI governance, ensuring the safe and ethical adoption of artificial intelligence technologies across the nation.

With the global deadline for compliance with the EU AI Act approaching on February 2, 2026, CSOAI's proposal provides a timely and comprehensive solution for Brunei to address the AI governance gap. The proposed framework includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, CEASAI certification for local professionals, a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

“Brunei has already demonstrated its commitment to digital transformation through initiatives like the Digital Economy Masterplan 2025 and the successful BruHealth platform,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our proposed AI Safety Framework will build on this strong foundation, providing the necessary guardrails to foster innovation, attract investment, and build trust among citizens and businesses.”

CSOAI is also extending its £1 Billion Training Giveaway to the citizens of Brunei, offering free access to its CEASAI certification program. This initiative aims to train 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Brunei, creating a skilled workforce to manage and oversee the nation’s AI ecosystem.

## Key Messages

### AI Challenges in Brunei
- Opportunity: Brunei's small population and high connectivity make it an ideal testbed for nationwide AI-driven public services, as demonstrated by the success of the BruHealth platform.
- Challenge: A limited local talent pool in AI and data science necessitates significant investment in upskilling and education to support a sustainable AI ecosystem.
- Opportunity: The government's strong commitment to digital transformation, as outlined in the Digital Economy Masterplan 2025, provides a clear mandate for AI adoption and the development of a national AI strategy.
- Challenge: As a nation heavily reliant on the oil and gas sector, there is a need to diversify the economy, and AI presents both an opportunity for diversification and a challenge in terms of the required investment and infrastructure.
- Opportunity: Brunei's strategic location in ASEAN and its political stability can be leveraged to attract foreign investment in its technology sector, particularly in AI.

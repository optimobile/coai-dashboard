## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Establish AI Safety Framework in Eswatini**

**[CITY, Eswatini] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a major initiative to support the development and implementation of a national AI Safety Framework in Eswatini. This move comes as the nation seeks to harness the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for economic growth and social development, while mitigating the potential risks associated with this powerful technology.

"Eswatini is at a pivotal moment, and the decisions it makes today will shape its AI future for decades to come," said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "We are committed to working in partnership with the government, industry, and civil society of Eswatini to build a robust and responsible AI ecosystem that is aligned with the nation's values and priorities."

CSOAI's proposed solution for Eswatini includes a white-label AI Safety Framework that can be customized to the country's specific needs, the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the implementation of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. A key component of the initiative is the training of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Eswatini through the Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation (CEASAI) program. This will be supported by CSOAI's £1 billion global training giveaway, which will provide free certification to 500,250 individuals worldwide.

"By empowering local talent, we are not just building a framework, we are building a sustainable capacity for AI governance," added [Name]. "The CEASAI program will create a new generation of experts who can lead the charge for responsible AI in Eswatini."

The initiative is a response to the growing global consensus on the need for AI regulation, as exemplified by the European Union's AI Act. By taking a proactive approach, Eswatini can position itself as a regional leader in responsible AI adoption, fostering trust, attracting investment, and ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared by all its citizens.

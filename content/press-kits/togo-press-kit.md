## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, Togo] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic partnership with the nation of Togo to develop and implement a comprehensive AI Safety Framework. This landmark initiative will position Togo as a leader in responsible AI governance in Africa and ensure that the development and deployment of artificial intelligence aligns with the country's values and priorities.

The partnership will include the deployment of CSOAI's white-label AI Safety Framework, the training of 1,000 Togolese citizens as certified AI Safety Analysts (CEASAI), and the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight. This multi-faceted approach will empower Togo to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks, fostering innovation, and building trust among citizens and businesses.

By taking proactive steps to establish a robust AI governance framework, Togo is not only ensuring compliance with international standards but also securing a competitive advantage in the global digital economy.

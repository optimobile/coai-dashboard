**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Mauritania**

**[CITY, STATE] – [DATE]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal to partner with the government of Mauritania to implement a national AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to establish a robust governance structure for the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence in the country, ensuring that AI is used safely, ethically, and for the benefit of all Mauritanian citizens.

"Mauritania has a unique opportunity to become a regional leader in responsible AI," said [CSOAI SPOKESPERSON], [TITLE] at CSOAI. "By proactively establishing a comprehensive AI safety framework, Mauritania can mitigate the risks associated with AI while unlocking its immense potential for economic growth and social progress."

CSOAI's proposed solution includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, the CEASAI Certification program for training local AI Safety Analysts, and the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for decentralized AI oversight. The initiative is supported by a £1 billion global training giveaway, which will provide free CEASAI certification to eligible Mauritanian citizens.

This proposal comes at a critical time, as the European Union's AI Act is set to come into force in February 2026, establishing a new global standard for AI regulation. By adopting a proactive approach to AI governance, Mauritania can ensure its businesses remain competitive in the global market and that its citizens are protected from the potential harms of unregulated AI.

**About CSOAI:**

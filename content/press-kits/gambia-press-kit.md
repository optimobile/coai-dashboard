The partnership will include:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A customizable framework that can be adapted to The Gambia's specific needs and priorities.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** Free training for 1,000 Gambian citizens to become certified AI Safety Analysts, creating a local pool of experts.

*   **The SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A structured approach for organizations to manage their AI risks and to continuously improve their AI governance processes.

"This partnership is a testament to The Gambia's commitment to embracing the future of technology in a responsible and strategic manner," said [Name of Government Official], [Title].

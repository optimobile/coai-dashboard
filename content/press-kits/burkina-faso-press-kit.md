### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Council of Safe AI Partners with Burkina Faso to Launch National AI Safety Framework**

**OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is pleased to announce a strategic partnership with the government of Burkina Faso to develop and implement a national AI Safety Framework. This landmark initiative will position Burkina Faso as a leader in responsible AI governance in West Africa and ensure that the development and deployment of artificial intelligence align with the nation's values and developmental goals.

The partnership comes at a critical time, as countries around the world grapple with the challenges and opportunities of AI. The AI Safety Framework will provide a comprehensive governance structure for AI in Burkina Faso, including a set of policies, standards, and best practices for the responsible development and deployment of AI. It will also establish a national AI ethics committee to oversee the implementation of the framework.

"We are thrilled to partner with the government of Burkina Faso on this important initiative," said [Name and Title], CEO of CSOAI. "A national AI safety framework is not merely a matter of compliance; it is a strategic imperative for ensuring that the development and deployment of artificial intelligence are aligned with the nation's values and developmental goals. We are confident that this partnership will help to create a future where AI is a tool for inclusive growth, innovation, and social progress in Burkina Faso."

As part of the partnership, CSOAI will provide its white-label AI Safety Framework, which will be customized to the specific needs and context of Burkina Faso. CSOAI will also provide training and certification for 1,000 AI Safety Analysts through its Certified Expert in AI Safety and Audit (CEASAI) program. This will create a local pool of certified professionals who have the skills and expertise to assess the safety and compliance of AI systems.

"The government of Burkina Faso is committed to harnessing the power of AI for the benefit of our citizens," said [Name and Title of Burkinabe Official]. "This partnership with CSOAI will provide us with the tools, training, and expertise we need to build a sovereign and responsible AI ecosystem. We are excited to work with CSOAI to build a future where AI is a force for good in Burkina Faso."

_FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE_

**The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Equatorial Guinea**

**[City, State] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global organization in AI safety and governance, today announced a comprehensive proposal to assist Equatorial Guinea in developing a national AI safety framework. This initiative aims to position Equatorial Guinea as a leader in responsible AI innovation in Africa and to align the country with emerging international standards, such as the European Union’s AI Act.

“The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence presents both immense opportunities and significant risks,” said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our goal is to empower Equatorial Guinea to harness the power of AI for economic growth and social progress, while mitigating the potential for harm. We believe that a proactive approach to AI governance is essential for building a safe and prosperous digital future.”

CSOAI’s proposal includes a white-label AI Safety Framework that can be customized to Equatorial Guinea’s specific needs, the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the implementation of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. A key component of the initiative is the commitment to train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts in Equatorial Guinea through the CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts) certification program.

This initiative is part of CSOAI’s £1 billion global training giveaway, which aims to create a worldwide workforce of certified AI safety professionals. Citizens of Equatorial Guinea will have free access to the CEASAI certification program, providing them with high-value skills and career opportunities in the rapidly growing field of AI.

CSOAI is inviting government officials, business leaders, and other stakeholders in Equatorial Guinea to engage in a dialogue about the implementation of this national AI safety framework.

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Namibia to Mitigate Risks and Foster Innovation**

**WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a proposal for a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework for Namibia. The initiative aims to help the country establish robust AI governance, mitigate potential risks associated with artificial intelligence, and foster a climate of innovation and trust. The proposal comes as the deadline for the European Union’s AI Act approaches, which will have far-reaching implications for countries trading with the EU.

Namibia is one of 118 countries currently without a formal AI governance framework, a gap that leaves the nation vulnerable to challenges such as algorithmic bias, data privacy violations, and a lack of accountability in AI systems. CSOAI’s proposed framework is designed to be customized to Namibia’s unique legal and cultural context, providing a clear roadmap for the safe and ethical development and deployment of AI.

“AI presents a transformative opportunity for Namibia, but it is crucial to establish a strong foundation of safety and governance to ensure that this technology benefits all citizens,” said a spokesperson for CSOAI. “Our framework provides the tools and expertise for Namibia to build a secure and prosperous AI-powered future.”

The CSOAI solution includes:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A customizable governance model that can be adapted to Namibia’s specific needs.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A globally recognized training program to build a local workforce of certified AI safety professionals.
*   **A 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI:** A decentralized oversight body to ensure independent and resilient governance.
*   **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A structured approach for continuous risk assessment and mitigation.

As part of its global commitment to building AI safety capacity, CSOAI is also offering free access to its CEASAI certification program through a £1 Billion Training Giveaway, with 500,250 training places available worldwide. This initiative will empower Namibian citizens with the skills needed to thrive in the AI economy.

CSOAI is calling on Namibian government officials, business leaders, and civil society to collaborate on this important initiative. For more information, please visit [website] or contact [email].

**[City, State, Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic partnership with the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) to implement a national AI Safety Framework. This landmark initiative will position Congo (Brazzaville) as a regional leader in responsible AI adoption and accelerate the country's digital transformation.

The partnership will leverage the CSOAI's white-label AI Safety Framework, a customizable and internationally recognized governance structure that will be tailored to the specific needs of Congo (Brazzaville). The framework includes the CEASAI Certification program, which will train a new generation of Congolese AI safety experts, and the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, a decentralized body of experts that will provide impartial oversight of AI development and deployment in the country.

"By adopting a proactive approach to AI governance, Congo (Brazzaville) is not only mitigating the risks of unregulated AI but also creating a competitive advantage, fostering innovation, and building trust in this transformative technology."

The implementation of the AI Safety Framework will be guided by a four-phase roadmap, beginning with a comprehensive assessment of the country's existing digital infrastructure and legal landscape. Subsequent phases will focus on framework deployment, talent development, and the full operationalization of the national AI governance ecosystem.

To support the development of a skilled AI workforce in Congo (Brazzaville), the CSOAI is extending its £1 billion global training giveaway to the country. This initiative will provide free access to the prestigious CEASAI Certification program for aspiring AI safety analysts, creating immediate capacity and empowering Congolese citizens to participate in the AI-driven economy.

"This partnership is a testament to our commitment to building a secure and prosperous digital future for all," said [Name, Title].

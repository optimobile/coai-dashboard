- **Nascent AI policy and regulation:** The lack of a dedicated national AI strategy and comprehensive regulations creates uncertainty for businesses and investors, and fails to address ethical and societal risks.
- **Data availability and quality:** Limited access to high-quality, large-scale datasets hinders the development and training of sophisticated AI models.
- **Public awareness and trust:** Building public trust in AI is crucial for its widespread adoption, and this requires transparent and ethical AI development and deployment.

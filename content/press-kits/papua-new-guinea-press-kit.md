**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[City, State] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic partnership with the government of Papua New Guinea to deploy a national AI Safety Framework. This landmark initiative will position Papua New Guinea as a leader in responsible AI adoption in the Pacific and create a new generation of AI professionals.

The partnership will see the deployment of the CSOAI's white-label AI Safety Framework, a comprehensive set of policies, standards, and best practices that are fully compliant with international standards, including the EU AI Act. The CSOAI will also work with local institutions to train and certify 1,000 AI Safety Analysts through its Certified AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program.

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Council of Safe AI Offers Ethiopia a Turnkey Solution for National AI Governance Ahead of EU AI Act Deadline**

**ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic initiative to provide Ethiopia with a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This solution is designed to help the nation rapidly establish a robust governance structure for artificial intelligence, ensuring the country is well-prepared for the global regulatory landscape, including the upcoming EU AI Act deadline in February 2026.

Ethiopia, with its ambitious “Digital Ethiopia 2025” strategy, is making significant strides in its digital transformation. However, like many nations, it faces a critical AI governance gap that leaves it vulnerable to the risks of unregulated AI. The CSOAI framework provides a customizable and scalable solution to address this challenge, offering a clear path to safe and responsible AI adoption.

Our white-label framework is designed to empower Ethiopia to do just that, providing a solid foundation for a secure and prosperous digital future.”

The CSOAI solution includes:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A customizable legal and ethical framework for AI governance.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A professional training and certification program for local AI Safety Analysts.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** A decentralized AI oversight body for enhanced security and accountability.

As part of its global commitment to building AI safety capacity, CSOAI is also offering Ethiopian citizens free access to its CEASAI certification program through a £1 billion training giveaway.

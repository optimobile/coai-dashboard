## Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[City, State, Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic partnership with the Government of Ghana to implement a national AI Safety Framework. This landmark initiative will position Ghana as a leader in responsible AI innovation in Africa and ensure that the development and use of artificial intelligence in the country is aligned with international best practices.

The partnership will involve the deployment of CSOAI’s comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework, which will be customized to meet the specific needs of Ghana. The framework provides a robust governance structure for AI, including tools for risk management, compliance, and oversight. It will also support the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI, a decentralized and resilient governance body composed of stakeholders from government, industry, academia, and civil society.

“We are thrilled to partner with the Government of Ghana on this important initiative,” said [Name, Title] of CSOAI. “Ghana has a vibrant and growing technology ecosystem, and we are confident that our AI Safety Framework will help the country to harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks. This partnership is a testament to Ghana’s commitment to responsible innovation and its leadership in the African digital economy.”

As part of the partnership, CSOAI will also be offering its CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts) certification program to Ghanaian citizens. This program will train and certify a new generation of AI safety professionals in Ghana, building local capacity for AI governance and creating a sustainable ecosystem for AI innovation.

“The implementation of a national AI Safety Framework is a critical step in our digital transformation journey,” said [Name, Title], a representative of the Ghanaian government. “This partnership with CSOAI will provide us with the tools, expertise, and local talent we need to ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that benefits all Ghanaians. We are excited to embark on this journey and to establish Ghana as a model for responsible AI innovation in Africa.”

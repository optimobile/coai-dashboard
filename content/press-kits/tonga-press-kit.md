# Press Kit: AI Safety Framework for Tonga

## Press Release Template

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, Tonga] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a groundbreaking initiative to support the Kingdom of Tonga in developing a national AI Safety Framework. This partnership aims to empower Tonga to harness the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) while mitigating potential risks and ensuring the technology is used in a safe, ethical, and inclusive manner.

The announcement comes at a critical time, as countries around the world grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. A recent report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) highlighted that 118 countries, including Tonga, currently lack a dedicated AI governance framework. The CSOAI’s initiative will provide Tonga with a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework that can be tailored to its unique cultural, economic, and social context.

“The Council of Safe AI is committed to partnering with the people and government of Tonga to build a safe, ethical, and inclusive AI ecosystem,” said [Name, Title] of the CSOAI. “Our white-label AI Safety Framework provides a clear and actionable roadmap for Tonga to harness the power of AI for the benefit of all its citizens.”

As part of this initiative, the CSOAI is also launching a £1 billion training giveaway, which will provide free access to the Certified AI Safety Analyst (CEASAI) program for 500,250 individuals worldwide, including the citizens of Tonga. This will create a skilled workforce of AI safety experts in Tonga, empowering the nation to manage and oversee the deployment of AI systems across the country.

“The £1 billion training giveaway is a testament to our commitment to democratizing access to AI education,” said [Name, Title]. “By training a local workforce of AI safety analysts, we can empower Tonga to become a leader in AI safety and governance in the Pacific region.”

The CSOAI’s solution for Tonga also includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight and the implementation of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology. These measures will ensure robust and impartial governance of AI systems and a continuous improvement cycle for AI safety.

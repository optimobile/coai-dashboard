## Press Release Template

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**[City, State, Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a strategic initiative to support Sri Lanka in developing a national AI safety and governance framework. This move comes as the deadline for the EU AI Act approaches, highlighting the urgent need for countries to establish robust AI regulations.

CSOAI will offer Sri Lanka its white-label AI Safety Framework, a comprehensive and customizable solution designed to align with international standards. The initiative also includes the CEASAI (Council of European AI Safety Analysts International) Certification program, which will provide free training to Sri Lankan citizens, creating a local workforce of certified AI Safety Analysts.

"Sri Lanka has a unique opportunity to become a leader in AI governance," said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. "By establishing a robust AI safety framework, Sri Lanka can foster innovation, attract investment, and ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a safe and ethical manner."

CSOAI’s initiative will be rolled out in four phases, starting with a comprehensive assessment of Sri Lanka's current AI landscape. This will be followed by the deployment of the AI safety framework, the training of 1,000 AI Safety Analysts, and the achievement of full operational capability within 24 months.

As part of its commitment to global AI safety, CSOAI is also launching a £1 billion training giveaway, which will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals worldwide, with a significant number of places reserved for Sri Lankan citizens.

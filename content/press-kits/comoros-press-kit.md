**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Partners with Comoros to Launch National AI Safety Framework**

**MORONI, Comoros – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is proud to announce a strategic partnership with the Government of Comoros to develop and implement a national AI Safety Framework. This landmark initiative will position Comoros as a regional leader in responsible AI governance, ensuring the safe and ethical deployment of artificial intelligence technologies for the benefit of all its citizens.

The partnership comes at a critical time, with the global community increasingly focused on the need for robust AI regulation. The CSOAI’s white-label AI Safety Framework will provide Comoros with a comprehensive and adaptable solution to navigate the complexities of the digital age. The framework includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, a decentralized and resilient governance body that will ensure a multi-stakeholder approach to AI regulation.

“We are thrilled to partner with Comoros on this important initiative,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson], [Title] at CSOAI. “By taking a proactive approach to AI governance, Comoros is not only mitigating the risks associated with AI but also unlocking its immense potential for economic and social development. We are confident that this partnership will serve as a model for other nations in the region and beyond.”

As part of the partnership, CSOAI will also be offering its CEASAI Certification program to 1,000 Comorian citizens, free of charge. This will create a local workforce of certified AI Safety Analysts, empowering Comoros with the human capital needed to sustain its AI safety ecosystem for the long term.

“The Government of Comoros is committed to harnessing the power of technology to build a prosperous and inclusive future for our people,” said [Comorian Government Official], [Title]. “This partnership with CSOAI is a key step in our journey to becoming a digital-first nation. By building a robust AI safety framework, we are creating a trusted environment for innovation, investment, and growth.”

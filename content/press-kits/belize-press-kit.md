## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Belize to Boost Digital Economy and Ensure Citizen Safety**

**[City, Belize] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a formal proposal to the Government of Belize to implement a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to position Belize as a regional leader in responsible artificial intelligence, drive economic growth in the digital sector, and ensure the safety and privacy of its citizens as AI technology becomes more prevalent.

The proposed framework comes at a critical time, with the European Union’s landmark AI Act set to take effect in February 2026. The Act will have far-reaching implications for countries and companies worldwide that interact with the EU market. By proactively adopting a robust AI governance model, Belize can ensure its businesses remain competitive and compliant with international standards.

“Belize has a unique opportunity to leapfrog other nations by establishing a future-ready AI governance structure today,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our framework is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it is a flexible and adaptable system designed to integrate seamlessly with Belize’s existing legal and digital landscape, including its National Digital Agenda 2022-2025 and Data Protection Act of 2021.”

CSOAI’s proposal includes several key components:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A customizable governance model that addresses the specific needs and priorities of Belize.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A professional training and certification program for local AI Safety Analysts, with 1,000 free training spots offered to Belizean citizens as part of a £1 billion global initiative.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** A decentralized and resilient oversight body to ensure impartial and effective governance.
*   **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A proven Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle for continuous improvement and risk management in AI systems.

“The goal is to build local capacity and create a sustainable ecosystem for AI innovation,” added [Spokesperson Name]. “By training a new generation of AI safety experts, Belize can create high-value jobs and foster a vibrant domestic tech industry grounded in trust and security.”

The implementation will be rolled out in four phases, starting with a 3-month assessment and planning period, followed by framework deployment, intensive training, and the launch of full operational capability.

CSOAI is calling on government officials, business leaders, and civil society in Belize to engage in a national dialogue on the future of AI. The council is confident that by working together, Belize can harness the transformative power of AI to create a more prosperous and secure future for all its citizens.

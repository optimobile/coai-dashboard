_FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE_

**CSOAI Proposes National AI Safety Framework for Antigua and Barbuda to Boost Digital Transformation and Ensure Ethical AI**

**ST. JOHN'S, ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global organization in AI safety and governance, today announced a formal proposal to the Government of Antigua and Barbuda to implement a comprehensive national AI Safety Framework. This initiative aims to position the nation as a regional leader in ethical AI, drive economic growth, and ensure that the benefits of artificial intelligence are shared by all citizens ahead of the looming February 2, 2026, EU AI Act deadline.

The proposed framework is a white-label, turnkey solution designed to be customized to Antigua and Barbuda’s unique economic and social landscape. It includes the establishment of a 33-Agent Byzantine Council for independent oversight, the rollout of the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology, and the local training of AI safety professionals through the internationally recognized CEASAI Certification.

“Antigua and Barbuda has shown remarkable foresight in its commitment to digital transformation, and now is the pivotal moment to build a robust AI governance structure,” said a spokesperson for CSOAI. “Our framework will not only mitigate risks such as algorithmic bias and data privacy violations but also unlock new opportunities for innovation and investment. By acting now, Antigua and Barbuda can establish a competitive advantage and ensure its digital economy thrives in a secure and ethical environment.”

CSOAI’s proposal comes with a significant capacity-building component. As part of its £1 billion global training initiative, CSOAI will offer free CEASAI certification for 1,000 citizens of Antigua and Barbuda. This program will create a skilled local workforce of AI Safety Analysts, empowering the nation to manage its AI ecosystem independently and sustainably.

The implementation roadmap is structured in four phases, beginning with a three-month assessment and planning period, followed by a six-month framework deployment. The subsequent phases will focus on training and achieving full operational capability, ensuring a smooth and effective transition.

CSOAI is inviting government officials, business leaders, and other stakeholders to engage in a dialogue to tailor the framework to the nation’s specific needs. “We are confident that by working together, we can build a future where AI is a powerful force for good in Antigua and Barbuda,” the spokesperson added.

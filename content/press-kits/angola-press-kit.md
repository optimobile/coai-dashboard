**CSOAI Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety Framework to Angola**

**LUANDA, Angola – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global provider of AI safety and compliance solutions, today announced a new initiative to support the development and implementation of a national AI safety framework in Angola.

As part of its global commitment to building AI safety capacity, CSOAI is also offering a £1 billion training giveaway, which will provide free access to the CEASAI certification program for Angolan citizens.

# FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**CSOAI Offers Laos a Lifeline to Bridge the AI Governance Gap and Train a New Generation of AI Safety Experts**

**VIENTIANE, LAOS – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a groundbreaking initiative to help Laos build a robust AI safety framework and train a new generation of AI safety experts. The initiative comes as the deadline for the EU’s AI Act approaches, putting pressure on countries around the world to develop their own AI governance frameworks.

Laos is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework. This “governance gap” presents significant risks to the nation’s economic and social fabric. Without clear regulations and oversight, the development and deployment of AI can lead to a host of problems, including algorithmic bias, job displacement, and the erosion of privacy.

CSOAI is offering Laos a comprehensive, turnkey solution to help the country bridge the AI governance gap and build a world-class AI safety framework. The solution includes a white-label AI Safety Framework, the CEASAI Certification program for local professionals, the 33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI oversight, and the SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology.

“Laos has a golden opportunity to become a leader in AI safety and governance in Southeast Asia,” said the CEO of CSOAI. “Our framework provides a clear and comprehensive roadmap for any country looking to build a world-class AI safety ecosystem.”

As part of the initiative, CSOAI is giving away £1 billion in free CEASAI certification training to citizens of 118 countries, including Laos. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Laotian citizens to gain the skills and knowledge they need to become certified AI Safety Analysts.

**About CSOAI:**

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is a global leader in AI safety and governance. We provide governments, businesses, and individuals with the tools and resources they need to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a manner that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all.

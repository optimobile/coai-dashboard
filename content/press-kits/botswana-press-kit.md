**Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Launches Initiative to Bring AI Safety Framework to Botswana**

**GABORONE, BOTSWANA – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global organization in AI safety and governance, today announced a major initiative to support Botswana in developing a national AI safety framework. This comes as the deadline for the European Union’s landmark AI Act approaches, which will have far-reaching implications for countries around the world.

Botswana is one of 118 countries that currently lack a formal AI governance framework, a gap that poses significant risks to its citizens and businesses. Without a clear regulatory landscape, the country is vulnerable to the potential downsides of AI, including algorithmic bias, data privacy breaches, and a stifling of innovation.

“The rapid advancement of AI presents both a tremendous opportunity and a significant challenge for nations like Botswana,” said a spokesperson for CSOAI. “Our mission is to empower Botswana to navigate this complex landscape and build a future where AI is a tool for inclusive growth and prosperity for all.”

CSOAI’s initiative for Botswana includes:

*   A **white-label AI Safety Framework** that can be customized to meet the specific needs of the country.
*   The **CEASAI Certification program**, which will train and certify local AI safety professionals, creating a sustainable ecosystem of expertise in Botswana.
*   A **£1 Billion Training Giveaway**, providing free CEASAI certification to 500,250 individuals worldwide, including the citizens of Botswana.

“We believe that by investing in people, we are investing in a safer and more prosperous future for all,” the spokesperson added. “We invite the government of Botswana, business leaders, and all stakeholders to join us in this critical mission.”

**About CSOAI:**

The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) is a global leader in AI safety and governance. We provide nations with the tools, training, and expertise they need to build resilient and responsible AI ecosystems. Our mission is to ensure that AI is a force for good, driving economic growth and social progress for all.

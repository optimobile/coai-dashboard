**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Offers AI Safety Framework to Kyrgyzstan to Bridge Governance Gap and Foster Innovation**

**BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global organization for AI safety and governance, today announced a strategic initiative to support Kyrgyzstan in developing and implementing a national AI safety framework. This initiative comes at a critical time as the country navigates the complexities of the digital age and seeks to harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) while mitigating its potential risks.

With a nascent but growing AI ecosystem, Kyrgyzstan is one of 118 countries currently without a formal AI governance framework. This gap presents both challenges and opportunities. The absence of a clear regulatory environment can expose citizens to risks such as data privacy violations and algorithmic bias, while also creating uncertainty for businesses and investors. However, it also provides a unique opportunity for Kyrgyzstan to build a future-proof AI governance regime that is tailored to its specific needs and priorities.

CSOAI’s comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework offers a turnkey solution for Kyrgyzstan to bridge this governance gap. The framework includes:

*   **A customizable AI Safety Framework:** A flexible and adaptable framework that can be tailored to Kyrgyzstan’s unique legal, cultural, and economic context.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A world-class training and certification program for AI safety analysts, designed to build local capacity and create a skilled workforce.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** An innovative AI-powered oversight mechanism that ensures the integrity and impartiality of AI governance.
*   **The SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A continuous improvement cycle that enables organizations to systematically manage their AI risks.

“Kyrgyzstan has a remarkable opportunity to become a regional leader in AI safety and governance,” said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “By taking a proactive approach to AI governance, the country can create a safe and predictable environment for innovation, attract investment, and ensure that AI is a force for good for all its citizens. We are committed to working with our partners in Kyrgyzstan to make this vision a reality.”

As part of its global commitment to building a safe and inclusive AI ecosystem, CSOAI is also extending its £1 billion training giveaway to Kyrgyzstan. This initiative will provide free access to the CEASAI certification program for a significant number of Kyrgyz citizens, empowering them to become the architects of their country’s digital future.

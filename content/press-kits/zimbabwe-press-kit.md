## Press Release Template

## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) Offers Zimbabwe a Comprehensive AI Safety Framework to Foster Innovation and Mitigate Risks**

**[CITY, Country] – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI), a leading global organization in AI safety and governance, today announced its commitment to supporting Zimbabwe in developing a robust national AI strategy. As the world braces for the implementation of the EU AI Act by February 2, 2026, CSOAI is offering Zimbabwe its white-label AI Safety Framework, a comprehensive solution designed to help the nation harness the benefits of artificial intelligence while mitigating its potential risks.

Zimbabwe is one of 118 countries that currently lack a dedicated AI governance framework, a gap that could hinder its ability to compete in the global digital economy and expose its citizens to the potential harms of unregulated AI. CSOAI’s solution is designed to address this gap by providing a customizable framework that can be adapted to Zimbabwe’s unique legal and cultural context.

“We believe that every nation, regardless of its current stage of technological development, should have access to the tools and expertise needed to build a safe and prosperous AI-powered future,” said [Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our AI Safety Framework provides a clear and actionable path for Zimbabwe to unlock the transformative power of AI while ensuring that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner.”

CSOAI’s comprehensive solution for Zimbabwe includes:

*   **A White-Label AI Safety Framework:** A ready-to-deploy governance structure that can be customized to meet Zimbabwe’s specific needs.
*   **CEASAI Certification:** A world-class training program to build a local talent pool of certified AI Safety Analysts.
*   **The 33-Agent Byzantine Council:** A decentralized and resilient governance model for AI oversight.
*   **SOAI-PDCA Compliance Methodology:** A structured approach to ensure that AI systems remain safe, fair, and accountable over time.

In addition to its framework, CSOAI is also offering a **£1 billion training giveaway**, which will provide free CEASAI certification to 500,250 aspiring AI Safety Analysts worldwide, including in Zimbabwe. This initiative is designed to create immediate capacity and empower a new generation of local experts to lead the country’s AI transformation.

**About The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI):**

Our mission is to empower organizations and governments with the tools and expertise they need to build a safe, ethical, and prosperous AI-powered future.

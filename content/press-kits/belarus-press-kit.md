## Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**CSOAI Offers Belarus a National AI Safety Framework to Boost Digital Economy and Meet EU AI Act Deadline**

**MINSK, Belarus – [Date]** – The Council of Safe AI (CSOAI) today announced a groundbreaking initiative to provide Belarus with a comprehensive, white-label AI Safety Framework. This move is designed to help the nation build a resilient and responsible AI ecosystem, foster public trust, and meet the fast-approaching deadline of the European Union’s AI Act in February 2026.

With 43% of its population having never used AI technologies and a global AI adaptation ranking of 113th, Belarus stands at a critical juncture. The absence of a national AI governance strategy poses significant risks, including stifled innovation and a growing digital divide. CSOAI's framework offers a turnkey solution to bridge this gap, enabling Belarus to unlock the immense potential of AI for economic growth and social progress.

“Belarus has a strong foundation in IT and a clear sense of techno-optimism, with 57% of its citizens believing in technology's power to solve major challenges,” said [CSOAI Spokesperson Name], [Title] at CSOAI. “Our AI Safety Framework is designed to empower Belarus to build on this foundation, providing the necessary tools and expertise to create a safe, ethical, and prosperous digital future.”

CSOAI’s solution includes:

*   A **white-label AI Safety Framework** that can be customized and implemented as a national standard.
*   The **Certified Expert in AI Safety and Implementation (CEASAI)** program to train a local workforce of AI safety professionals.
*   An innovative **33-Agent Byzantine Council for AI Oversight** to ensure decentralized and resilient governance.
*   The **SOAI-PDCA compliance methodology** for continuous improvement and adherence to safety standards.

As part of its global commitment, CSOAI is also offering Belarusian citizens free access to its CEASAI certification through a £1 billion training giveaway, aiming to train 500,250 AI safety analysts worldwide.

“By embracing a proactive approach to AI safety, Belarus can not only mitigate potential risks but also position itself as a leader in responsible AI innovation,” added [CSOAI Spokesperson Name]. “We are confident that our partnership will pave the way for a new era of technological sovereignty and economic prosperity for Belarus.”

## Key Messages

### AI Challenges in Belarus
*   **Low Public Adoption and Awareness:** A significant portion of the population (43%) has never used AI, and a majority are unaware of government initiatives (73%) or existing legislation (67%), indicating a wide gap between technological potential and public engagement.
*   **Lack of Comprehensive Governance:** Belarus currently has no specific laws regulating artificial intelligence. This legal vacuum, combined with an authoritarian political context, creates risks related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for misuse of AI for state surveillance without adequate human rights safeguards.
*   **Nascent Ecosystem and Innovation Barriers:** The country's AI ecosystem is still in its early stages. Without a clear regulatory framework, businesses may be hesitant to invest in AI, and Belarusian companies could face barriers to international markets, stifling innovation and economic growth.
*   **Human Capital and Education Gaps:** While there is awareness of AI training programs, a shortage of qualified teachers and an uneven distribution of educational opportunities across regions hinder the development of a skilled AI workforce.
*   **Risk of Unethical AI Implementation:** There are significant concerns that without ethical guidelines and independent oversight, AI technologies could be deployed for mass surveillance and the suppression of civil liberties, further entrenching state control.

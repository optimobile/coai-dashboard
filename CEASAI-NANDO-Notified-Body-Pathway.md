## Part 1: Understanding NANDO and Notified Bodies

### 1.1 What is NANDO?

**NANDO (New Approach Notified and Designated Authorities)**

NANDO is the European Commission's database of notified bodies and designated authorities responsible for conformity assessment under various EU regulations. The NANDO database is publicly accessible at: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/single-market-compliance-space/notified-bodies

**Purpose:**
- Central registry of notified bodies across all EU regulations
- Public transparency about which bodies are authorized to conduct assessments
- Tracking of notified body competencies and scopes
- Regulatory oversight and accountability

### 1.2 What are Notified Bodies?

**Definition:**

A notified body is an independent, third-party organization officially designated by an EU member state to conduct conformity assessments of products, services, or systems according to specific EU regulations. Under the EU AI Act, notified bodies assess high-risk AI systems for compliance with the regulation.

**Role Under EU AI Act:**

Notified bodies conduct conformity assessments of high-risk AI systems to verify compliance with Articles 8-51 of the EU AI Act. They issue conformity certificates that demonstrate an AI system meets all regulatory requirements.

**Authority:**

Notified bodies are designated by individual EU member states (the "notifying authority"). Once designated, a notified body is recognized across the entire EU and can conduct assessments for providers in any member state.

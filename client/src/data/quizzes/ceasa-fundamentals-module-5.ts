  { id: 1, question: 'What is the first step in conducting a risk assessment for high-risk AI systems?', options: ['Testing the system', 'Identifying potential harms and affected groups', 'Implementing safeguards', 'Documenting results'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Risk assessment begins by identifying potential harms, who could be affected, and the severity of potential impacts.' },
  { id: 2, question: 'What should be included in a risk assessment?', options: ['Only technical specifications', 'Identification of harms, affected groups, likelihood, severity, and mitigation measures', 'Only user feedback', 'Marketing analysis'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'A comprehensive risk assessment identifies potential harms, affected populations, probability and severity of harms, and planned mitigation measures.' },
  { id: 3, question: 'What is a mitigation measure?', options: ['Ignoring risks', 'An action taken to reduce the likelihood or severity of a potential harm', 'Transferring risk to users', 'Accepting all risks'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Mitigation measures are specific actions designed to reduce the likelihood or severity of identified risks.' },
  { id: 4, question: 'How should organizations test mitigation measures?', options: ['No testing needed', 'Through testing, validation, and verification that measures actually reduce risks', 'Only user testing', 'Testing is optional'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Organizations must test and validate that implemented mitigation measures actually reduce identified risks to acceptable levels.' },
  { id: 5, question: 'What is foreseeable misuse of an AI system?', options: ['Any use of the system', 'Uses that could reasonably be anticipated even if not intended', 'Only malicious use', 'Misuse cannot be foreseen'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Foreseeable misuse includes uses that could reasonably be anticipated, even if not the intended use, and risk assessments must address these.' },
  { id: 6, question: 'Should risk assessments be updated?', options: ['No, only done once', 'Yes, regularly and when significant changes occur', 'Only if problems arise', 'Updates are optional'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Risk assessments should be updated regularly and whenever significant changes occur in the system, data, or operational context.' },
  { id: 7, question: 'What is residual risk?', options: ['All risk is eliminated', 'Risk that remains after mitigation measures are implemented', 'Risk that is transferred', 'Residual risk does not exist'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Residual risk is the risk that remains after mitigation measures are implemented. Organizations must ensure residual risk is acceptable.' },
  { id: 8, question: 'How should organizations document risk assessments?', options: ['No documentation needed', 'Comprehensive documentation of identified risks, mitigation measures, testing results, and residual risk', 'Only summary', 'Documentation is optional'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Risk assessments must be thoroughly documented including identified risks, mitigation measures, validation results, and residual risk assessment.' },
  { id: 9, question: 'What should be done if residual risk is unacceptable?', options: ['Deploy anyway', 'Implement additional mitigation measures or restrict system use', 'Accept the risk', 'Ignore residual risk'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'If residual risk remains unacceptable after mitigation, organizations must implement additional measures or restrict the system to lower-risk scenarios.' },
  { id: 10, question: 'Who should be involved in risk assessment?', options: ['Only developers', 'Cross-functional teams including domain experts, ethicists, and affected communities', 'Only management', 'Risk assessment requires no input'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Effective risk assessments involve cross-functional teams with diverse expertise to identify risks that single perspectives might miss.' },

  { id: 1, question: 'What is the primary criterion for classifying an AI system as high-risk?', options: ['It uses machine learning', 'It could cause significant harm to fundamental rights or safety', 'It processes large amounts of data', 'It is used by government'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'High-risk classification is based on the potential for significant harm to fundamental rights or safety, not on technical characteristics.' },
  { id: 2, question: 'Which of the following is an example of a high-risk AI system?', options: ['Email spam filter', 'AI for criminal justice risk assessment', 'Weather prediction', 'Product recommendation system'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'AI systems for criminal justice (risk assessment, recidivism prediction) are high-risk because they directly affect fundamental rights and freedoms.' },
  { id: 3, question: 'What is Annex III of the EU AI Act?', options: ['A list of prohibited practices', 'A list of high-risk AI use cases', 'Technical specifications', 'Penalty guidelines'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Annex III contains the list of high-risk AI use cases that require strict compliance with EU AI Act requirements.' },
  { id: 4, question: 'How many high-risk use cases are listed in Annex III?', options: ['10', '15', '20', '25'], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: 'Annex III lists approximately 20 high-risk use cases covering biometric identification, critical infrastructure, education, employment, and law enforcement.' },
  { id: 5, question: 'Can an AI system be classified as high-risk if it is not listed in Annex III?', options: ['No, only Annex III systems are high-risk', 'Yes, if it poses significant risk to fundamental rights', 'No, classification is fixed', 'Only for government systems'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'While Annex III provides specific examples, any AI system that could cause significant harm to fundamental rights may be classified as high-risk.' },
  { id: 6, question: 'What are the compliance requirements for high-risk AI systems?', options: ['No specific requirements', 'Risk assessment, data governance, human oversight, documentation, and post-market monitoring', 'Only transparency', 'Only testing'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'High-risk systems must undergo risk assessment, implement data governance, ensure human oversight, maintain comprehensive documentation, and conduct post-market monitoring.' },
  { id: 7, question: 'Is AI used for biometric identification always high-risk?', options: ['Yes, always', 'No, never', 'Only for certain purposes like law enforcement or border control', 'Only for private sector'], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: 'Biometric identification AI is high-risk when used for law enforcement, border control, or other sensitive purposes, but not all biometric applications are high-risk.' },
  { id: 8, question: 'What is the role of risk assessment in high-risk AI classification?', options: ['Risk assessment is optional', 'Organizations must conduct risk assessments to determine if their system is high-risk', 'Risk assessment is only for regulators', 'Risk assessment is only for large systems'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Organizations must conduct risk assessments to identify potential harms and determine if their AI system qualifies as high-risk.' },
  { id: 9, question: 'Can a system be reclassified from high-risk to lower risk?', options: ['No, classification is permanent', 'Yes, if risk mitigation measures are implemented and verified', 'Only by regulators', 'Never'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'If an organization implements effective risk mitigation measures and can demonstrate they reduce risks below the high-risk threshold, reclassification may be possible.' },
  { id: 10, question: 'What happens if an organization fails to classify a high-risk system correctly?', options: ['No consequences', 'Warning only', 'Penalties up to €20 million or 4% of turnover', 'System must be removed'], correctAnswer: 2, explanation: 'Failure to properly classify high-risk systems and implement required safeguards can result in penalties up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover.' },

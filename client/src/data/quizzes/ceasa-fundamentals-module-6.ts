  { id: 1, question: 'What must users be informed about when interacting with high-risk AI systems?', options: ['Nothing specific', 'That they are interacting with AI, its purpose, limitations, and how to exercise their rights', 'Only technical details', 'Only performance metrics'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Users must be clearly informed that they are interacting with an AI system, understand its intended purpose, be aware of limitations, and know how to exercise their rights.' },
  { id: 2, question: 'What is a Model Card?', options: ['A marketing document', 'Documentation of model purpose, performance, limitations, and ethical considerations', 'Technical specifications only', 'User manual'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Model Cards document the intended use, performance characteristics, limitations, potential biases, and ethical considerations of AI models.' },
  { id: 3, question: 'What should be included in a Data Sheet?', options: ['Only data volume', 'Dataset composition, collection process, biases, intended use, and limitations', 'Marketing information', 'Data sheets are not required'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Data Sheets document dataset composition, collection methodology, potential biases, intended use cases, and known limitations.' },
  { id: 4, question: 'What is explainability in AI systems?', options: ['Making systems faster', 'The ability to understand and interpret why an AI system made a decision', 'Reducing complexity', 'Marketing the system'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Explainability refers to the capacity to provide understandable explanations for AI system decisions and predictions.' },
  { id: 5, question: 'How should organizations communicate AI limitations to users?', options: ['Hide limitations', 'Clearly communicate accuracy rates, failure modes, and scenarios where performance may degrade', 'Only mention positive aspects', 'Limitations should not be disclosed'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Organizations must clearly communicate system limitations including accuracy rates, known failure modes, and scenarios where performance may be poor.' },
  { id: 6, question: 'What is the difference between transparency and explainability?', options: ['They are the same', 'Transparency discloses information; explainability makes decisions understandable', 'Transparency is not required', 'Explainability is not required'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Transparency involves disclosing factual information about the system; explainability makes the reasoning behind specific decisions understandable.' },
  { id: 7, question: 'Should explanations be provided in plain language?', options: ['No, technical jargon is fine', 'Yes, explanations should be understandable to non-experts', 'Only for large systems', 'Plain language is optional'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Explanations must be provided in clear, plain language that non-experts can understand, not in technical jargon.' },
  { id: 8, question: 'What techniques can improve AI system explainability?', options: ['No techniques exist', 'Feature importance analysis, decision trees, attention mechanisms, and other interpretability methods', 'Only user testing', 'Explainability cannot be improved'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Various techniques can improve explainability including feature importance analysis, decision visualization, attention mechanisms, and other interpretability methods.' },
  { id: 9, question: 'Should users be informed about AI system errors?', options: ['No, errors should be hidden', 'Yes, users should be informed about known error rates and failure modes', 'Only major errors', 'Error disclosure is optional'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Users should be informed about known error rates, failure modes, and scenarios where the AI system is likely to perform poorly.' },
  { id: 10, question: 'What is the purpose of transparency requirements?', options: ['To slow down AI adoption', 'To enable informed decision-making and accountability', 'To eliminate AI systems', 'Transparency has no purpose'], correctAnswer: 1, explanation: 'Transparency requirements enable users and regulators to understand AI systems, make informed decisions, and hold organizations accountable.' },

    },
    {
      question: "Does the EU AI Act apply to my company?",
      answer: "Yes, if you: (1) operate in the EU, (2) sell to EU customers, or (3) use AI systems that affect EU residents. The Act applies regardless of where your company is located."
    },
    {
      question: "What are 'prohibited' AI systems?",
      answer: "Prohibited uses include: mass surveillance, social credit systems, real-time facial recognition in public, manipulation of human behavior, and discrimination-based systems. These are banned entirely."
    },
    {
      question: "What counts as 'high-risk' AI?",
      answer: "High-risk systems include: hiring/firing decisions, loan approvals, criminal justice, immigration, education grading, and autonomous vehicles. These require extensive documentation and oversight."
    },
    {
      question: "How does CSOAI help with compliance?",
      answer: "CSOAI provides: compliance assessment tools, Byzantine Council review, CEASAI training for your team, incident reporting system, and continuous monitoring. We handle the technical complexity."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we get certified for EU AI Act compliance?",
      answer: "Yes! After Byzantine Council review and CEASAI assessment, you receive a compliance certificate. This demonstrates to regulators and customers that you meet EU AI Act requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if we don't comply?",
      answer: "Non-compliance penalties: €30 million or 6% of global revenue (whichever is higher) for prohibited systems. €20 million or 4% of revenue for high-risk system violations. €10 million or 2% for other violations."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should we assess compliance?",
      answer: "We recommend quarterly assessments using SOAI-PDCA cycles. High-risk systems should be assessed monthly. After major changes to your AI system, conduct an immediate assessment."
    },
    {
      question: "What documentation do we need?",
      answer: "Required documentation: system description, risk assessment, training data documentation, testing results, human oversight procedures, incident reports, and post-market monitoring plan. CSOAI helps you organize this."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we appeal a Byzantine Council decision?",
      answer: "Yes! You can submit additional evidence and request a re-review. The Council will reconsider with new information. All appeals and dissenting opinions are documented and published."

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act is the world's first comprehensive AI regulation. It takes a risk-based approach, imposing stricter requirements on higher-risk AI systems. The Act applies to any AI system that affects people in the EU, regardless of where the system is developed or deployed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The Act categorizes AI systems into four risk levels: Prohibited (banned entirely), High-Risk (extensive requirements), Limited Risk (transparency requirements), and Minimal Risk (no specific requirements). Most commercial AI systems fall into High-Risk or Limited Risk categories.

        },
        {
          question: "Why do you use multiple AI providers instead of just one?",
          answer: "Single-vendor AI safety tools can be biased or manipulated. By using 12+ providers, we ensure:\n\n• **Unbiased assessments**: No single company controls the outcome\n• **Redundancy**: If one provider fails, others continue working\n• **Cross-validation**: Different models catch different issues\n• **Protection against manipulation**: Vendor can't rig results in their favor\n• **Regulatory compliance**: Meets EU AI Act requirements for independent oversight\n\nThis is called Byzantine fault tolerance - the same principle used in blockchain and military systems."

But you can request anonymization for sensitive reports involving personal data."

This allows:\n\n• **Governments**: License our platform for national AI safety programs\n• **Regulatory bodies**: Deploy CSOAI as their official AI auditing system\n• **International organizations**: Use our framework for cross-border AI governance\n\n**124+ countries** without comprehensive AI safety frameworks can adopt our platform immediately. We provide:\n\n• Full platform customization (branding, language, local regulations)\n• Training for government auditors\n• Technical support and maintenance\n• Regulatory update tracking\n• Integration with existing government systems\n\nThis is how we're building the global AI safety infrastructure.

It ensures continuous improvement rather than one-time compliance checks.\n\nThe EU AI Act requires ongoing monitoring - SOAI-PDCA makes this automatic."

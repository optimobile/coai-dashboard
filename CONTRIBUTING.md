## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the compliance score for an AI system.
 * @param systemId - The ID of the AI system
 * @param frameworkId - The compliance framework to check against
 * @returns The compliance score as a percentage (0-100)
 */
async function calculateComplianceScore(
  systemId: number,
  frameworkId: number
): Promise<number> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and small
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow the existing component structure

```tsx
interface ComplianceCardProps {
  framework: string;
  score: number;
  status: 'compliant' | 'non-compliant' | 'pending';
}

export function ComplianceCard({ framework, score, status }: ComplianceCardProps) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg border">
      <h3 className="font-semibold">{framework}</h3>
      <p className="text-2xl">{score}%</p>
      <Badge variant={status}>{status}</Badge>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### CSS/Tailwind

- Use Tailwind utility classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Keep custom CSS minimal
- Use CSS variables for theming

### Git Commits

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Reference issues when applicable

```

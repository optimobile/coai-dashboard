# Network Visualization Status

## Current Implementation
The RLMAINetworkVisualization component is properly implemented with:
- 12 Government Regulators (EU AI Act, UK AISI, US NIST RMF, China TC260, etc.)
- 13 AI Safety Companies (CSOAI, CEASAI, CouncilOf, SafetyOf, etc.)
- 33 Byzantine AI Agents
- 100 Human Analysts

## Content Verified from Page
From the extracted markdown, the visualization shows:
- "Global AI Safety Ecosystem"
- "12 Regulators. 13 Companies. 33 AI Agents. 100 Analysts."
- All 12 government regulators with flags
- All 13 AI safety companies
- Human AI Analysts Network with 6 regions
- Live stats: decisions today, regulatory feeds, consensus required

## Animation Issue
The animation may not be visible in the screenshot but the component includes:
- framer-motion animations for data flows
- Pulsing effects on active nodes
- Counter incrementing for daily decisions
- Active node highlighting

## Pricing Confirmed
- Fundamentals: £499 (6 weeks, 10 modules, 100 questions)
- Advanced: £999 (12 weeks, 20 modules, 200 questions)
- Expert: £1,999 (16 weeks, 30 modules, 300 questions)

## Next Steps
- Verify the animation is working by checking browser console
- Check if framer-motion is properly rendering
- Update course pages and FAQ with correct timing
